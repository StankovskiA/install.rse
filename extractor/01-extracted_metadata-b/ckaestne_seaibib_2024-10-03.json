Good introduction to the problem and based on practical experience at Google. Despite it's broader scope it is still model-centric and  focuses only on the ML pipeline, not how it interacts with the rest of the system. Includes some examples and a checklist of QA steps to consider. (Note this is a slightly extended version from a similarly titled paper) \n> My own discussion of the role of specifications in machine learning. Many testing papers below that focus on model quality (rather than infrastructure quality, as Breck above) are rather vague and confusing to me with regard to specifications. I argue that machine learning corresponds to the requirements engineering phase of a project rather than the implementation phase and, as such, terminology that relates to validation (i.e., do we build the right system, given stakeholder needs) is more suitable than terminology that relates to verification (i.e., do we build the system right, given a specification). That is, machine learning suggests a specification (like specification mining and invariant detection) rather than provides an implementation for a known specification (like synthesis). \n> The paper discusses quality attributes of a production ML system beyond just the ML components. It is explicit about considering multiple views of different components, of the entire system, and of the environment the system is embedded it. These views are useful for guiding a discussion of which qualities to consider. Importantly, the paper provides a concrete example of a system by Fujitsu and lists a large number of qualities considered in Table 1 -- very useful for teaching. \n",

Grey literature is not discussed either. \n> Yet another survey paper on ML testing. It frames the problem as testing the entire system with an ML component, but rarely goes beyond quality assurance just for the model. Somewhat biased toward self-driving cars. Again, I have quite some quibbles with many claims and definitions, e.g. model vs system or what is a specification or what is a bug. As for the other surveys, I'd suggest to use it for an overview and skim for the pointers. \n",

Nice analogy to blackbox testing (they frame it in terms of combinatorial testing, though equivalence classes may be a better fit). Approach is used to slice data rather than generate new test data, which aligns also with Hulten's recommendations and [my lecture](https://ckaestne.github.io/seai/S2020/slides/04_modelquality/modelquality.html)/[blog post](https://medium.com/@ckaestne/a-software-testing-view-on-machine-learning-model-quality-d508cb9e20a6) on testing. \n> Overview of a system design (at Apple) that focuses on slicing and improving training data incrementally.

                "value": "*A number of different papers discuss (more or less explicitly) how to test specific capabilities or partial specifications of a model \u2013 which relates closely to traditional unit testing. Capabilities are usually concepts that a model shall learn that mirror domain knowledge or human strategies toward the problem, but that only capture a specific part of the solution. The approaches usually curate or generate test datasets specifically for these capabilities \u2013 i.e., unit tests consisting of multiple data points. Assuring capabilities is associated (more or less explicitly) with selecting more robust models that better generalize beyond the training distribution. Several capabilities also relate to invariants described below.* \n> Paper suggests ways of generating test cases for capabilities of NLP models: First step is to list specific capabilities of a model (e.g., to handle negation or typos in sentences); for each capability then test cases are curated. Test cases are created by writing simple template-based generators (think: QuickCheck) of sentences with holes, where tool support is given for identifying values for those holes (synonyms etc). The model is then tested on those generated sentences, either by giving an expected value (e.g., all sentences generated from a template are positive) or by using invariants (metamorphic relations), see below. The paper shows many examples of tests and invariants; the evaluation shows that this approach of testing is useful for production teams to test whether the models actually learn basic capabilities. \n> Similar to the CheckList paper, this paper identifies 6 capabilities for NLP models, after performing an error analysis of common wrong predictions (think: root cause analysis). Capability tests are separated as competency tests, distraction tests, and noise tests, each encoding tests for specific capabilities, such as understanding antonyms or ignoring spelling errors. Test data is generated following handwritten patterns. The term \u201cstress test\u201d is explicitly introduced, but I consider it very misleading from a software testing perspective. \n> The paper argues strongly for evaluating models with tests of core abstractions of the task (similar to the checklist paper above, which they call stress tests) beyond just evaluating accuracy on data samples taken from the same population. While the paper focuses on showing that models with similar accuracy can differ in how they generalize to other distributions (is this really surprising?), it contains several pointers to papers where the community seems to pick up on the importance of additional tests. \n> Excellent and easy to read survey of the problem of shortcut learning (i.e. not using intended capabilities) and some directions to address it. Good introduction and examples; very good (visual) description of i.i.d. vs out-of-distribution concerns. \n> Very short paper showing with an illustrative experiment the importance of learning the right structure for a task, rather than surface learning. Very explicit about how the right linguistic structure (and nothing else) is needed to generalize beyond the training distribution (\u201clinguistic generalization\u201d). \n> Very high level survey of different approaches to use domain knowledge *in addition* to data during training in machine learning. Provides a good overview and classification of different approaches. Domain knowledge can have many forms such as rules and constraints, some might correspond to invariants and capabilities. This has potential implications for robustness, fairness, capabilities, and safety. (Not quite sure where to categorize this \u2013 it is not about quality assurance, but kind of the inverse of capability testing, by encoding the domain knowledge directly during training rather than testing it after the fact)\n \n",

The key idea is that in the absence of a specification about what the model should do (which is the whole point of using ML), we might still be able to give partial specifications in terms of invariants about how outputs should relate for input pairs. For example, robustness conditions might be expressed by indicating that similar inputs should produce the same output or that linearly scaling all features or adding irrelevant features should not affect the outcome for certain classifiers. This is an interesting direction that enables testing of a number of invariants for ML models. The paper gives many pointers to other work in this area. \n> This is an example of a large group of paper that proofs specific invariants about models. For example, the specification could be that a model is robust to certain changes to its inputs (e.g., changing the brightness of pixels by +/- 20%) on the training set or certain classes of inputs. In contrast to much testing work, here results are verified over all input changes covered by a specification. \n> Another application of testing invariants: here, for fairness certain outputs should be independent of changes to sensitive attributes. To simple for practical use in my book; limited to \"fairness through blindness\" (or \"unawareness\" or \"anti-classification\") and group fairness (but seemingly without addressing correlations in the data, since samples are generated uniformly). \n> Approach for explaining black-box models that is essentially invariant mining, not that far from Daikon. The paper identifies rules that, with high probability, are sufficient to explain a specific prediction for a subset of all inputs. These invariants can then explain part of the model and could potentially be used as partial specifications or test cases. \n> Discusses use cases of \u201csoft\u201d assertions or invariants that show inconsistencies, especially across time series data and across multiple classifiers, without having to have access to labels. Table 5 in the appendix has a very good overview of different invariants and the paper discusses several plausible examples. Note that these invariants are probabilistic in nature rather than hard tests. This can be used for testing and runtime monitoring (e.g., runtime adaptation and safety mechanisms) without the need for labels! Unfortunately, the paper is very vague about concrete interfaces and technical details and focuses primarily on ML details for additional active learning and weak supervision use cases. \n",

The core of the paper is about deciding how much test data is needed and when it needs to be replaced. The CI framing seems rather incidental or even misleading though, as the key problem does not relate to regression testing but toward deciding whether a model outperforms another. \n> Differential testing between multiple models (e.g., learned from the same data with different parameters) and input generation that aims to identify inputs that have different outputs across the models. Unclear to me how useful this would be in practice. \n> Good framing why formal verification (or really any form of testing) is so difficult in machine learning systems in the first two sections: We neither have a specification, nor a good grasp of the environment, and in addition the system is often evolving itself. After explaining why it is so difficult, the paper points to several potentially interesting research areas, but none of them seem to overcome the fundamental problems, especially that of missing specifications. \n> Approach to explore correlations between protected attributes and prediction outcomes in *subpopulations* of the dataset. The key idea is that there may not be such a correlation (generalizes to various fairness measures on the confusion matrix) for the entire population, but it may well exists for certain subpopulations, e.g., only among low-income residence do we observe gender-based discrimination.

Explanations can be shown to the user (though the book is fairly shallow on the challenges of doing this and larger system design questions), but they also seem very useful in understanding model (mis-)behavior, understanding individual wrong predictions and outliers. The book covers both techniques for understanding the model and understanding characteristics of the training data. Written in a fairly accessible and pragmatic style, covering the important math but also providing good intutions. \n> Good and compact overview of different goals and notions of explainablity, interpretability, trust, and transparency and a quick overview of different techniques in this area. \n> Uses a SE mindset (delta debugging, slicing) to approach the problem of debugging deep neural networks, especially to identify features that are critical for misbehavior with the goal of providing better learning data (framed as \"root cause identification\" of \"training bugs\"). Fairly pragmatic. \n> Interesting idea to identify which inputs to a machine-learning algorithm have large effects on the produced model (i.e., some form of sensitivity analysis). Focused on specific classes of graph-based algorithms like Pagerank. \n> Approach to automatically identify subsets of the data for which the model accuracy is lower than average/other subsets. This automatically slices the validation data based on different features (like decision tree learning). Not that different from approaches in the [Slicing Test Data](#22-slicing-test-data) section, but not guided by humans, hence this seems more useful for debugging than for (regression) testing. Also briefly mentions applications to different quality functions, including fairness and accuracy difference after model update. Paper is heavily focused on underlying technical approach. \n> Description and evaluation of a visual debugging tool to explore wrong predictions and possible causes. Supports use cases for detecting mislabled data, missing features, and outliers. Integrated into the larger ML pipeline for labeling and data management. Also nice overview of other visualization techniques in related work. \n> Neat idea on debugging training data: Use a trusted subset of the data to see whether other untrusted training data is responsible for wrong predictions in this subset, or what\u2019s the smallest change to the training data to make the model work on the trusted data. \n \n",

This paper has a strong system focus, showing how a narrow focus on modeling undervalues data collection, data quality work, and the entire outcome of the system. Discusses many different notions of data quality, beyond just schema. Discusses involving humans, incentives, power structures, and documentation in data collection. Excellent introduction to the literature around data quality (with many pointers). Interview study with 53 participants from India, USA and East and West\n> African countries.

Data work adds a human component, requires oversight and domain knowledge but is often not valued. \n> Follow up to the data cascades paper, studying through interviews how people performing data collection and data entry are often perceived as lazy, corrupt, and low status but not as partners. Also surveying interventions often involving surveillance and incentives. Highlighting an often broken collaboration, resulting in data quality issues. \n> Similar in spirit to the Amazon paper above, describes data validation efforts at Google, mostly at a fairly high level. Mostly relates to schema enforcement and detecting drift between feature value distributions between batches of data. Also describes some efforts at suggesting schema inference (effectively specification/invariant mining) to help with adoption and evolution. Also suggests some simple fuzzing to detect crashing bugs in ML components for generated inputs that fit the schema. Can be read as support for schemas as interfaces between teams and components in ML-based systems.  \n> Neat idea to develop a linter that looks for common \"code smells\" in dataset and internal data structures (e.g., when integers are stored as strings). This is an early but great example of how some classic SE ideas (static analysis tools, dynamic invariant detection, code smells) can be translated to solve new problems in an ML context. It is not quite obvious how far one can take this idea, but it is a great starting point for discussions and a nice illustration of potential SE4ML work. \n> Description of Snorkel, an approach to semi-automatically label training data, where humans provide partial training functions (e.g., labeling some instances based simply on some keywords). The system will learn automatically which of these partial labels to trust and will produce training labels at scale. This is an interesting strategy to gather training data that may work in a number of domains and has been used by a number of companies -- worth exploring. Many further discussions can be based on this, e.g., how to combine manual labels with different confidence, how to combine manual and automatic labels, which labels to trust, how much to involve crowdworkers in labeling and on which data points, etc. \n> DVC (https://dvc.org/) is an open source tool for versioning data\n> and ML workflows.

Not a detailed discussion and no detailed pattern description, but pointers to the sources, a list of patterns names, and an overview of their relations, that are likely useful for further exploration and discussions, see their [web site](http://www.washi.cs.waseda.ac.jp/ml-patterns/). Many of the patterns seem to relate more to big-data processing than ML, but are likely useful when building ML-enabled systems.  \n> Paper discussing the infrastructure for learning and serving ML models at Facebook (including discussions of hardware design). Discusses many quality attributes and constraints that are relevant in operation, including cost, latency, model-updated frequency needs, large amounts of data, and ability to recover from outages. For example, it includes an explicit discussion of the cost of outdated models. Much of this is useful input for discussing design constraints and architectural tradeoffs. \n> Interesting paper analyzing the source code and architecture of the Baidu\u2019s Apollo self-driving car software. Finding 28 models that are often chained and combined with nontrivial glue code and non-ML components. This makes a strong case to go beyond testing individual models but to test also the interactions with non-ML code and the interactions among multiple models. \n> Interview study with 18 participants on MLOps, eliciting pain points and practices. Decent overview and introduction to MLOps practices. Entirely model-centric focused on deploying a model and pipeline, not the rest of the system using the model.

Mostly fairly high-level; among others, emphasizes the system nature of the problem and ideas with regard to design strategies for safety, such as safety cages and fail-safe systems. \n> (Discussed also above under model invariants) This is an example of a large group of paper that determines whether all pertubations of an input within a certain bound all produce the same prediction. The search space by these pertubations and their combinations is typically very large and formal methods are used to produce conservative results (i.e., when it reports robustness against these pertubations it actually guaranteed to always return the same prediction, but there can be false positives). This is one of the more readable papers in this area that I have seen, but I'm not aware of any paper that really discusses how to use these robustness guarantees in production (typical scenarios seem to be to test robustness for a training set, for a set of important test cases, or to test it at runtime to make sure that a specific result is not just caused by a pertubation) and whether the considered pertubations are relevant or interesing for practical cases. \n> Discusses *randomized smoothing*, an interesting approach to evaluating robustness: Sample predictions not only about a specific input but also about perturbed versions of that input around that input and report the most common prediction as the result. As a consequence, the prediction will be less sensitive to minor changes in the input. Black box technique that works for any kind of model. If sampled frequently enough, as discussed in the paper, also probabilistic bounds can be provided, although at significant computational costs (they use 100K model inferences per input). \n> Well argued short position paper on how to integrate uncertainty and monitoring in safety cases and goal modeling notations. Essentially acknowledges that not all problems can be foreseen, but instead provides means to express uncertainty and a mandate to monitor the system in production and add more codncerns and evidence when new problem categories are surfaced. \n> A high-level overview of how lay people approach risk not objectively, but how additional factors like dread and a lack of control play a big role in perceiving risk. In contrast, well understood, present, concrete and voluntary risks are perceived as less important.

It mostly stays fairly close to the model with more detailed content on the ML pipeline (including guidance for quality assurance and debugging), whereas the coverage of requirements engineering and deployment is more high-level and shallow. Overall a nice book with a healthy engineering attitude and a view that exceeds beyond the ML model. \n> Nice case study paper from a team at Google that explicitly discusses the various challenges of building an ML-based system that go beyond just the modeling part, including issues like automatic calibration, composing many models, and teamwork in interdisciplinary teams. Include an architecture diagram. Despite some vagueness, we use it in class as a case study to show the importance of software engineering in ML projects. \n> One of many books explaining how various machine-learning techniques (including a quite extensive treatment of deep learning), and also shows pragmatically how to use the corresponding techniques with various libraries. Spends about half a page talking very superficially about deployment and evaluation in production (Section \"Launch, Monitor, and Maintain Your System\"), but is otherwise squarely in the data science camp. Overall accessible and quite detailed introduction that invites to immediate play with some datasets and build some models. \n> Essay/position paper with many pointers from the Tensorflow team. Key message is that ML can learn from data management community. Interesting, but not very deep and the survey part seems ad-hoc. \n> Discussion of SE challenges in deep learning projects. Useful list of challenges, apparently grounded in interviews with engineers in 7 projects. The discussion remains rather abstract with little explicit grounding in the interview data. \n> Discussion of challenges observed in a concrete industrial machine learning project with SAP. Observations are high-level lessons learned expressed as many rules and recommendations. Unfortunately, there is little discussion of research methods or how the rules trace to observations in the project. \n> Excellent book about distributed and big data systems. Not directly related to machine learning, but covers fundamentals of data storage and data processing (batch, stream, ...) at scale. Excellent discussion of principles and tradeoffs. \n> High-level description of the machine learning infrastructure for building pipelines and model deployment by Google. Discusses engineering concerns and integrated tools across the entire pipeline, including among others automation and tracking in data transformation, training, and deployment.  \n> Extensive study of problems data scientists face when using deep learning frameworks, using interviews, issue analysis (of projects using these frameworks!), and stackoverflow questions. Problems mostly related to network architecture, hyperparameters, and data quality. \n> Very formal paper using simulation to study the effects of feedback loops of recommender systems on filter bubbles and echo chambers. Helps understanding the problem and thinking of solutions as part of the system\u2019s design.\n \n",

Many concrete implementation examples given in Scala. The book is very readable but opinionated and somewhat narrow and low level. It describes specific implementation patterns for design solutions it suggests, but it definitively reflects on tradeoffs and software engineering concerns. \n> Study of operational issues of large map reduce cluster. Mostly hardware failures not captured by redundancy mechanisms. No direct ML aspect, but useful for discussing large distributed ML jobs at scale and some discussion of debugging from logging data. \n> Brief discussion of 7 case studies, mostly finding MLOps-style problems. The paper concludes with a potentially interesting maturity model (Sec 5), that, while not visibly grounded in data, may be a good starting point for discussions for framing different kinds of ML projects. \n> Discussion of challenges in developing ML systems based on interviews and a survey. Unfortunately, the paper does not distinguish consistently between the ML model, the framework used to learn the model, and the the system with an ML component, nor does it clearly distinguish between roles of software engineers or data scientists, leading to rather murky claims. \n> Proposes a goal model extension for requirements engineering that explicitly considers alternative designs dependenting on how well a ML model performs (yet to be determined, deferring the decision during design). The paper has an interesting discussion about the challenge of prototyping in ML, where it may be very difficult to establish feasbility until very late in the project. \n> Position paper listing a number of open research challenges for AI engineering in several application domains. These observations are based on consulting and interviews with companies (small start-ups to large corporations) in various domains, though no clear traceability is provided. Main focus is on ML components rather than the whole system. \n> Machine learning book with a decent engineering focused, albeit still almost entirely model centric. Covers entire ML pipeline from data collection, to feature engineering, to modeling, to model deployment and monitoring, often in a compact way. Especially the coverage of data quality exceeds typical books in this area. \n> One of the better of the many recent MLOps books. This does not only explain specific tools (e.g., pytest, AWS, Postman, Sparks), but also provides more general technical explanation and engineering rationals for many decisions. \n",

Unit Testing / Testing Capabilities\n\n*A number of different papers discuss (more or less explicitly) how to test specific capabilities or partial specifications of a model \u2013 which relates closely to traditional unit testing. Capabilities are usually concepts that a model shall learn that mirror domain knowledge or human strategies toward the problem, but that only capture a specific part of the solution. The approaches usually curate or generate test datasets specifically for these capabilities \u2013 i.e., unit tests consisting of multiple data points. Assuring capabilities is associated (more or less explicitly) with selecting more robust models that better generalize beyond the training distribution. Several capabilities also relate to invariants described below.*\n\nKaestner, Christian. \"[Rediscovering Unit Testing: Testing Capabilities of ML Models](https://towardsdatascience.com/rediscovering-unit-testing-testing-capabilities-of-ml-models-b008c778ca81).\" Medium Blog Post. 2021.\n\n> Shameless plug of my blogpost discussing this area and several papers in it more systematically, including how to identify capabilities and how to curate tests.\n\nRibeiro, Marco Tulio, Tongshuang Wu, Carlos Guestrin, and Sameer Singh. \"[Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~wtshuang/static/papers/2020-acl-checklist.pdf).\" In Proceedings ACL, p. 4902\u20134912. (2020).\n\n> Paper suggests ways of generating test cases for capabilities of NLP models: First step is to list specific capabilities of a model (e.g., to handle negation or typos in sentences); for each capability then test cases are curated. Test cases are created by writing simple template-based generators (think: QuickCheck) of sentences with holes, where tool support is given for identifying values for those holes (synonyms etc). The model is then tested on those generated sentences, either by giving an expected value (e.g., all sentences generated from a template are positive) or by using invariants (metamorphic relations), see below. The paper shows many examples of tests and invariants; the evaluation shows that this approach of testing is useful for production teams to test whether the models actually learn basic capabilities.\n\nNaik, Aakanksha, Abhilasha Ravichander, Norman Sadeh, Carolyn Rose, and Graham Neubig. \"[Stress test evaluation for natural language inference](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1198.pdf).\" Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, p. 2340--2353 (2018).\n\n> Similar to the CheckList paper, this paper identifies 6 capabilities for NLP models, after performing an error analysis of common wrong predictions (think: root cause analysis). Capability tests are separated as competency tests, distraction tests, and noise tests, each encoding tests for specific capabilities, such as understanding antonyms or ignoring spelling errors. Test data is generated following handwritten patterns. The term \u201cstress test\u201d is explicitly introduced, but I consider it very misleading from a software testing perspective.\n\nMcCoy, R. Thomas, Ellie Pavlick, and Tal Linzen. \"[Right for the wrong reasons: Diagnosing syntactic heuristics in natural language inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01007).\" Proc. ACL (2019).\n\n> Inverse strategy from testing capabilities: Testing for known common shortcuts (maybe anti-capabilities). They identify three shortcut heuristics often used by NLP models (no discussion how identified and how this would generalize) and then create test data using patterns, not unlike the stress testing and CheckList papers above. That is, instead of testing capabilities, the absence of shortcut heuristics is tested.\n\nKaushik, Divyansh, Eduard Hovy, and Zachary C. Lipton. \"[Learning the difference that makes a difference with counterfactually-augmented data](https://openreview.net/pdf/6267805abf4a2ab7b3f971c759b8c669e6060774.pdf).\" Proc. International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), (2020).\n\n> Another paper that (implicitly) discusses capabilities of NLP systems. In the context of a sentiment analysis, they instruct crowd-workers to minimally modify existing sentences to change the sentiment of the text. They similarly instruct crowd-workers to minimally modify sentences to change the outcome of inference tasks. By manually analyzing the kind of changes their participants make, they find 15 common patterns, which could be interpreted as capabilities they want the model to understand, such as sarcasm, distinguishing facts from hopes, and negation. While aimed at collecting additional training data rather than generating test data, the same strategy can be used to identify capabilities and to curate test data for those capabilities.\n\nTalmor, Alon, Yanai Elazar, Yoav Goldberg, and Jonathan Berant. \"[oLMpics-on what language model pre-training captures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13283).\" *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics* 8 (2020): 743-758.\n\n> Another paper that proposes generators for creating test data for 9 specific capabilities for NLP reasoning tasks, including numeric reasoning, distinguishing always from often, handling conjunctions of facts and multi-hop reasoning.

(Not quite sure where to categorize this \u2013 it is not about quality assurance, but kind of the inverse of capability testing, by encoding the domain knowledge directly during training rather than testing it after the fact)\n\n### 2.4. Model Invariants\n\nSegura, Sergio, Gordon Fraser, Ana B. Sanchez, and Antonio Ruiz-Cort\u00e9s. \"[A survey on metamorphic testing](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/74235918.pdf).\" IEEE Transactions on software engineering 42, no. 9 (2016): 805-824.\n\n> This paper discusses the idea of metamorphic testing and summarizes much work in this area. The key idea is that in the absence of a specification about what the model should do (which is the whole point of using ML), we might still be able to give partial specifications in terms of invariants about how outputs should relate for input pairs. For example, robustness conditions might be expressed by indicating that similar inputs should produce the same output or that linearly scaling all features or adding irrelevant features should not affect the outcome for certain classifiers. This is an interesting direction that enables testing of a number of invariants for ML models. The paper gives many pointers to other work in this area.\n\n\nRibeiro, Marco Tulio, Sameer Singh, and Carlos Guestrin. \"[Semantically equivalent adversarial rules for debugging NLP models](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1079.pdf).\" In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 856-865. 2018.\n\n> Example of testing for invariants in NLP models (in line with metamorphic testing, even though they do not refer to that concept). Here one expects certain linguistic invariants, for example, replacing \"isn't\" by \"is not\" should not change the outcome. These invariants are used to derive and prioritize tests and to then improve the model with more input data.\n\nSingh, Gagandeep, Timon Gehr, Markus P\u00fcschel, and Martin Vechev. \"[An abstract domain for certifying neural networks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3290354).\" Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages 3, no. POPL (2019): 1-30.\n\n> This is an example of a large group of paper that proofs specific invariants about models. For example, the specification could be that a model is robust to certain changes to its inputs (e.g., changing the brightness of pixels by +/- 20%) on the training set or certain classes of inputs. In contrast to much testing work, here results are verified over all input changes covered by a specification.\n\nGalhotra, Sainyam, Yuriy Brun, and Alexandra Meliou. \"[Fairness testing: testing software for discrimination](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3106237.3106277).\" In Proceedings of the 2017 11th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering, pp. 498-510. 2017.\n\n> Another application of testing invariants: here, for fairness certain outputs should be independent of changes to sensitive attributes. To simple for practical use in my book; limited to \"fairness through blindness\" (or \"unawareness\" or \"anti-classification\") and group fairness (but seemingly without addressing correlations in the data, since samples are generated uniformly).\n\n\nDing, J., D. Zhang, and X. Hu. 2016. \u201c[A Framework for Ensuring the Quality of a Big Data Service](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/7557343/7557418/07557439.pdf).\u201d In 2016 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC), 82\u201389.\n\n> Another example of using metamorphic testing, using domain knowledge about the problem to come up with invariants.

The paper identifies rules that, with high probability, are sufficient to explain a specific prediction for a subset of all inputs. These invariants can then explain part of the model and could potentially be used as partial specifications or test cases.\n\nKang, Daniel, Deepti Raghavan, Peter Bailis, and Matei Zaharia. \"[Model Assertions for Monitoring and Improving ML Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01668).\" In Proceedings of MLSys 2020.\n\n> Discusses use cases of \u201csoft\u201d assertions or invariants that show inconsistencies, especially across time series data and across multiple classifiers, without having to have access to labels. Table 5 in the appendix has a very good overview of different invariants and the paper discusses several plausible examples. Note that these invariants are probabilistic in nature rather than hard tests. This can be used for testing and runtime monitoring (e.g., runtime adaptation and safety mechanisms) without the need for labels! Unfortunately, the paper is very vague about concrete interfaces and technical details and focuses primarily on ML details for additional active learning and weak supervision use cases.\n\nSalay, Rick, and Krzysztof Czarnecki. \"Improving ML safety with partial specifications.\" In *International Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability, and Security*, pp. 288-300. Springer, Cham, 2019.\n\n> Good discussion of why providing specifications for ML models is infeasible, followed by a somewhat abstract but well argued discussion of how partial specifications may be used in many different ways regardless. The discussion, while fairly abstract, covers several different facts, including suggesting that some specifications may be feasible on learned intermediate representations, that probabilistic constraints may be provided for data, that partial specifications may be provided for how to safely process model outputs, or that partial  specifications may be encoded during training.\n\n\n### 2.5. Testing ML Frameworks\n\nSrisakaokul, Siwakorn, Zhengkai Wu, Angello Astorga, Oreoluwa Alebiosu, and Tao Xie. \"[Multiple-implementation testing of supervised learning software](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW18/paper/viewPDFInterstitial/17301/15599).\" In Workshops at the Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. 2018.\n\n> Good example of a paper that tests the implementation of the ML algorithm (not the model or resulting system). Here differential testing is used to compare multiple student implementations. Nice demonstration of the idea, though it is not clear how far this would be practical beyond fairly simple learning algorithms implemented in student projects.\n\nXie, Xiaoyuan, Joshua WK Ho, Christian Murphy, Gail Kaiser, Baowen Xu, and Tsong Yueh Chen. \"[Testing and validating machine learning classifiers by metamorphic testing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121210003213).\" Journal of Systems and Software 84, no. 4 (2011): 544-558.\n\n> This paper applies metamorphic relations to the learning framework itself. That is, it defines invariants/assertions about how inputs (training data) and outputs (learned models) should relate.\n\nCheng, Dawei, Chun Cao, Chang Xu, and Xiaoxing Ma. \"[Manifesting bugs in machine learning code: An explorative study with mutation testing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/8424855/8424858/08424982.pdf).\" In *2018 IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security (QRS)*, pp. 313-324. IEEE, 2018.\n\n> Using mutation testing to mutate the machine learning code (e.g. SVM) to see how robust the ML implementations are to subtle faults. Shows that many mutations to the learning code lead to small degradation of accuracy of the produced models without a crash and that metamorphic testing (as in the paper above) was also not useful to find these kinds of faults.\n\n### 2.6. Quality Assurance in Production\n\n*Model accuracy is often not a very useful metric in itself. In practice it is important to assess the system with real-world inputs. In this context, designing  telemetry, monitoring systems, and running A/B experiments is very common.*\n\nBernardi, Lucas, Themistoklis Mavridis, and Pablo Estevez. \"150 successful machine learning models: 6 lessons learned at Booking.com.\" In Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, pp. 1743-1751. 2019.\n\n> Experience report of building various models in a production system, examples of ML-driven products (seems to start with \"what could we predict\" rather than with \"what does this product need\").

IEEE, 2017.\n\n> Approach to explore correlations between protected attributes and prediction outcomes in *subpopulations* of the dataset. The key idea is that there may not be such a correlation (generalizes to various fairness measures on the confusion matrix) for the entire population, but it may well exists for certain subpopulations, e.g., only among low-income residence do we observe gender-based discrimination. The key contribution is an efficient search among subpopulations inspired by decision tree learning algorithms. Explicitly adopts testing and debugging terminology and goes beyond the simple invariants (anti-classification) in many other fairness testing papers, i.e., it can account for unfairness through correlated attributes.\n\n## 3. Debugging and Explainability Tools\n\n*How do we understand what a model does and why it is wrong? Debugging seems closely related with the quest for interpretability, even if just through approximations. This can focus on the model as well as on the data or the learning algorithm. (Some interpretability/explanability papers are listed in the [Transparency](#12-transparency-accountability-and-policy) section below, because they focus on how end user rather than developers understand explanations.)*\n\nMolnar, Christoph. \"[Interpretable machine learning. A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)\", 2019. \n\n> Though primarily about interpretability, this book provides a great overview of techniques to understand and debug models. \nThe book covers both inherently interpretable models and many techniques for ex-post explanations inferred from blackbox models. Explanations can be shown to the user (though the book is fairly shallow on the challenges of doing this and larger system design questions), but they also seem very useful in understanding model (mis-)behavior, understanding individual wrong predictions and outliers. The book covers both techniques for understanding the model and understanding characteristics of the training data. Written in a fairly accessible and pragmatic style, covering the important math but also providing good intutions.\n\nLipton, Zachary C. \"[The Mythos of Model Interpretability: In machine learning, the concept of interpretability is both important and slippery](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3236386.3241340).\" *Queue* 16, no. 3 (2018): 31-57.\n\n> Good and compact overview of different goals and notions of explainablity, interpretability, trust, and transparency and a quick overview of different techniques in this area.\n\nBhatt, Umang, Alice Xiang, Shubham Sharma, Adrian Weller, Ankur Taly, Yunhan Jia, Joydeep Ghosh, Ruchir Puri, Jos\u00e9 MF Moura, and Peter Eckersley. \"[Explainable machine learning in deployment](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3351095.3375624).\" In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, pp. 648-657. 2020.\n\n> An interview study asking practioners about how they use explainability techniques.

Fairness\n\n*Much of the interesting fairness discussions are really about requirements engineering in my book. Once a fairness measure and protected attributes are defined, measurement is typically not very challenging. The challenge is in identifying what notion of fairness is appropriate, a typical requirements engineering problem (and process challenge) negotiating the demands of various stakeholders. Here are a couple of papers that I liked.*\n\nCorbett-Davies, Sam, and Sharad Goel. \"[The measure and mismeasure of fairness: A critical review of fair machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00023).\" arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00023 (2018).\n\n> A comprehensive an critical discussion of different fairness measures often discussed in the ML community. It's kind of depressing how many different notions and problems there are and how few solutions. Even though they don't discuss requirements engineering in the paper, I put it here because it shows the complicated mess that fairness makes when trying to identify the right fairness requirements for an ML-enabled system. A requirements engineer must work with stakeholders to identify suitable requirements and make a lot of decisions, which won't be easy but will be necessary. This paper will probably give the requirements engineer the right vocabulary to talk to ML experts who need to assure the requirement and will provide enough pointers to identify what issues to probe for when talking to stakeholders.\n\nHolstein, Kenneth, Jennifer Wortman Vaughan, Hal Daum\u00e9 III, Miro Dudik, and Hanna Wallach. \"[Improving fairness in machine learning systems: What do industry practitioners need?](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/docs/daume19fairness.pdf)\" In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-16. 2019.\n\n> An interview study with engineers that consider fairness in their ML-enabled products.

Safety & Robustness\n\n*There is a significant amount of machine learning research on safety and security, especially on narrow properties of robustness, but also some system-level discussions on safeguard mechanisms outside of the model.

Many testing papers in the section Quality Assurance above cover robustness properties.*\n\nBorg, Markus, Cristofer Englund, Krzysztof Wnuk, Boris Duran, Christoffer Levandowski, Shenjian Gao, Yanwen Tan, Henrik Kaijser, Henrik L\u00f6nn, and Jonas T\u00f6rnqvist. \"[Safely entering the deep: A review of verification and validation for machine learning and a challenge elicitation in the automotive industry](https://www.atlantis-press.com/journals/jase/125905766).\" Journal of Automotive Software Engineering.

This is one of the more readable papers in this area that I have seen, but I'm not aware of any paper that really discusses how to use these robustness guarantees in production (typical scenarios seem to be to test robustness for a training set, for a set of important test cases, or to test it at runtime to make sure that a specific result is not just caused by a pertubation) and whether the considered pertubations are relevant or interesing for practical cases.\n\n\nCohen, Jeremy M., Elan Rosenfeld, and J.

Human-AI Interaction\n\n*This area is interesting and has seen significant attention recently, but goes beyond my typical software engineering considerations. See the [Human-AI Interaction](http://www.humanaiclass.org/) class at CMU for more pointers.*\n\nYang, Qian. \"[The role of design in creating machine-learning-enhanced user experience](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS17/paper/viewPaper/15363).\" In *2017 AAAI Spring Symposium Series*. 2017.\n\n> Excellent position paper arguing that currently most AI-enabled systems are driven by data availability rather than a vision for a product, leading to poor user experiences. Argues for the importance of designing the user interaction before or with developing the model, which needs AI literacy from UI designers and interdisciplinary collaboration. Has several good pointers to literature for going deeper.\n\nKocielnik, Rafal, Saleema Amershi, and Paul N. Bennett. \"[Will you accept an imperfect AI?

They distinguish intrinsic trust which requires that a user\u2019s prior believe align with how the model reasons (here explanations and capability tests are useful) and extrinsic trust from a positive track record in production or a rigorous evaluation as the two key directions to increase trust.

Computational Notebooks\n\n*There is quite a bit of work on computational notebooks recently, mostly \nfocused on the exploratory work that data scientists perform.

Interdisciplinary Teams\n\n*Building software systems with machine learning components requires expertise in several domains, almost always by bringing together people with different backgrounds in interdisciplinary teams. Several papers explore how to foster such collaboration in a ML context, often with a focus on understanding particularly the interactions between data scientists and software engineers.*\n\nKim, Miryung, Thomas Zimmermann, Robert DeLine, and Andrew Begel. \"[Data scientists in software teams: State of the art and challenges](https://doi.org/10.1109/tse.2017.2754374).\" IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering 44, no. 11 (2017): 1024-1038.\n\n> Discusses the role of data scientists and their challenges through interviews and surveys.

Lots of problems arise at the interface between the ML component and the rest of the system. Engineering is often undervalued, ML is difficult to fit into the larger process, documentation at the interfaces is often a big problem, and even communication across discipline boundaries can be difficult. The paper highlights that team structures differ substantially, but that certain problems associated with certain decisions such as whether to develop the model first and then build a system around it or whether to start with the system.\n\nBusquim, Gabriel, Hugo Villamizar, Maria Julia Lima, and Marcos Kalinowski. \"[On the Interaction Between Software Engineers and Data Scientists When Building Machine Learning-Enabled Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05334).\" In *International Conference on Software Quality*, pp. 55-75.

This encourages to have a broader view of explainability in machine learning.\n\nAlkhatib, Ali, and Michael Bernstein. \"[Street-level algorithms: A theory at the gaps between policy and decisions](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300760).\" In *Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*, pp. 1-13. 2019.\n\n> Essay paper with three examples suggesting to use the idea of street-level bureaucracy (bureaucrats who make local decisions with some flexibility when administering the law) to explain some friction in rolling out automated decision making, especially when it comes to outliers and novel situations that bureaucrats and react can detect while ML automation does not.

After explaining why it is so difficult, the paper points to several potentially interesting research areas, but none of them seem to overcome the fundamental problems, especially that of missing specifications.\n\nTramer, Florian, Vaggelis Atlidakis, Roxana Geambasu, Daniel Hsu, Jean-Pierre Hubaux, Mathias Humbert, Ari Juels, and Huang Lin. \"[FairTest: Discovering unwarranted associations in data-driven applications](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/249325231.pdf).\" In 2017 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P), pp. 401-416.

The key idea is that there may not be such a correlation (generalizes to various fairness measures on the confusion matrix) for the entire population, but it may well exists for certain subpopulations, e.g., only among low-income residence do we observe gender-based discrimination. The key contribution is an efficient search among subpopulations inspired by decision tree learning algorithms. Explicitly adopts testing and debugging terminology and goes beyond the simple invariants (anti-classification) in many other fairness testing papers, i.e., it can account for unfairness through correlated attributes.\n\n## 3. Debugging and Explainability Tools\n\n*How do we understand what a model does and why it is wrong? Debugging seems closely related with the quest for interpretability, even if just through approximations. This can focus on the model as well as on the data or the learning algorithm. (Some interpretability/explanability papers are listed in the [Transparency](#12-transparency-accountability-and-policy) section below, because they focus on how end user rather than developers understand explanations.)*\n\nMolnar, Christoph. \"[Interpretable machine learning. A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)\", 2019. \n\n> Though primarily about interpretability, this book provides a great overview of techniques to understand and debug models. \nThe book covers both inherently interpretable models and many techniques for ex-post explanations inferred from blackbox models. Explanations can be shown to the user (though the book is fairly shallow on the challenges of doing this and larger system design questions), but they also seem very useful in understanding model (mis-)behavior, understanding individual wrong predictions and outliers. The book covers both techniques for understanding the model and understanding characteristics of the training data.

Fairness\n\n*Much of the interesting fairness discussions are really about requirements engineering in my book. Once a fairness measure and protected attributes are defined, measurement is typically not very challenging. The challenge is in identifying what notion of fairness is appropriate, a typical requirements engineering problem (and process challenge) negotiating the demands of various stakeholders. Here are a couple of papers that I liked.*\n\nCorbett-Davies, Sam, and Sharad Goel. \"[The measure and mismeasure of fairness: A critical review of fair machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00023).\" arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00023 (2018).\n\n> A comprehensive an critical discussion of different fairness measures often discussed in the ML community. It's kind of depressing how many different notions and problems there are and how few solutions. Even though they don't discuss requirements engineering in the paper, I put it here because it shows the complicated mess that fairness makes when trying to identify the right fairness requirements for an ML-enabled system. A requirements engineer must work with stakeholders to identify suitable requirements and make a lot of decisions, which won't be easy but will be necessary. This paper will probably give the requirements engineer the right vocabulary to talk to ML experts who need to assure the requirement and will provide enough pointers to identify what issues to probe for when talking to stakeholders.\n\nHolstein, Kenneth, Jennifer Wortman Vaughan, Hal Daum\u00e9 III, Miro Dudik, and Hanna Wallach. \"[Improving fairness in machine learning systems: What do industry practitioners need?](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/docs/daume19fairness.pdf)\" In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-16. 2019.\n\n> An interview study with engineers that consider fairness in their ML-enabled products.

Software Architecture and Design\n\n*Design of machine-learning pipelines, and more importantly design of systems that use machine learning components.

Patterns are described in lots of details with examples and concrete code snippets. It is very model focused and example driven, but covers the whole machine learning pipeline including feature engineering, training, and serving.

Safety & Robustness\n\n*There is a significant amount of machine learning research on safety and security, especially on narrow properties of robustness, but also some system-level discussions on safeguard mechanisms outside of the model. A software engineering professional should probably understand the tools and techniques. Many testing papers in the section Quality Assurance above cover robustness properties.*\n\nBorg, Markus, Cristofer Englund, Krzysztof Wnuk, Boris Duran, Christoffer Levandowski, Shenjian Gao, Yanwen Tan, Henrik Kaijser, Henrik L\u00f6nn, and Jonas T\u00f6rnqvist. \"[Safely entering the deep: A review of verification and validation for machine learning and a challenge elicitation in the automotive industry](https://www.atlantis-press.com/journals/jase/125905766).\" Journal of Automotive Software Engineering.

The search space by these pertubations and their combinations is typically very large and formal methods are used to produce conservative results (i.e., when it reports robustness against these pertubations it actually guaranteed to always return the same prediction, but there can be false positives). This is one of the more readable papers in this area that I have seen, but I'm not aware of any paper that really discusses how to use these robustness guarantees in production (typical scenarios seem to be to test robustness for a training set, for a set of important test cases, or to test it at runtime to make sure that a specific result is not just caused by a pertubation) and whether the considered pertubations are relevant or interesing for practical cases.\n\n\nCohen, Jeremy M., Elan Rosenfeld, and J.

Human-AI Interaction\n\n*This area is interesting and has seen significant attention recently, but goes beyond my typical software engineering considerations. See the [Human-AI Interaction](http://www.humanaiclass.org/) class at CMU for more pointers.*\n\nYang, Qian. \"[The role of design in creating machine-learning-enhanced user experience](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS17/paper/viewPaper/15363).\" In *2017 AAAI Spring Symposium Series*. 2017.\n\n> Excellent position paper arguing that currently most AI-enabled systems are driven by data availability rather than a vision for a product, leading to poor user experiences. Argues for the importance of designing the user interaction before or with developing the model, which needs AI literacy from UI designers and interdisciplinary collaboration. Has several good pointers to literature for going deeper.\n\nKocielnik, Rafal, Saleema Amershi, and Paul N. Bennett. \"[Will you accept an imperfect AI?

They distinguish intrinsic trust which requires that a user\u2019s prior believe align with how the model reasons (here explanations and capability tests are useful) and extrinsic trust from a positive track record in production or a rigorous evaluation as the two key directions to increase trust. They specifically talk about how adhering to partial contracts may be sufficient to establish trust, but remain somewhat vague on the concept beyond some vague references to subpopulations and capabilities.\n\n## 14. Computational Notebooks\n\n*There is quite a bit of work on computational notebooks recently, mostly \nfocused on the exploratory work that data scientists perform.

They characterize the kinds of problems developers and users tend to have, some some solutions. Many issues seem to be common framework issues, such as documentation issues and breaking APIs. Some challenges, such as probabilistic correctness and missing debuggers, seem more ML specific.\n\nDilhara, Malinda, Ameya Ketkar, and Danny Dig. \"[Understanding Software-2.0: a study of machine learning library usage and evolution](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3453478).\" *ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)* 30, no. 4 (2021): 1-42.\n\n> Analysis of how machine learning libraries are used in popular Python code on GitHub, complementary to past studies of library use in notebooks (see Computational Notebooks section above).

The paper focuses on a mechanism to detect this when one has no control over the service, but I think the larger picture may be even more important for thinking about interface design: How to version (public or internal) prediction services and how to communicate such changes.\n\n## 11. Interdisciplinary Teams\n\n*Building software systems with machine learning components requires expertise in several domains, almost always by bringing together people with different backgrounds in interdisciplinary teams. Several papers explore how to foster such collaboration in a ML context, often with a focus on understanding particularly the interactions between data scientists and software engineers.*\n\nKim, Miryung, Thomas Zimmermann, Robert DeLine, and Andrew Begel. \"[Data scientists in software teams: State of the art and challenges](https://doi.org/10.1109/tse.2017.2754374).\" IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering 44, no. 11 (2017): 1024-1038.\n\n> Discusses the role of data scientists and their challenges through interviews and surveys.

Lots of problems arise at the interface between the ML component and the rest of the system. Engineering is often undervalued, ML is difficult to fit into the larger process, documentation at the interfaces is often a big problem, and even communication across discipline boundaries can be difficult. The paper highlights that team structures differ substantially, but that certain problems associated with certain decisions such as whether to develop the model first and then build a system around it or whether to start with the system.\n\nBusquim, Gabriel, Hugo Villamizar, Maria Julia Lima, and Marcos Kalinowski. \"[On the Interaction Between Software Engineers and Data Scientists When Building Machine Learning-Enabled Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05334).\" In *International Conference on Software Quality*, pp. 55-75.

The study is based on interviews with managers at companies and IBM consultants and uses a sensemaking framing. It is rather challenging to read, but the results section is interesting.\n\n## 12. Transparency, Accountability, and Policy\n\n*Discussions of explanations as they relate to end users and policies, in contrast to explanations and explainability tools that developers might use for debugging discussed in [Debugging](#3-debugging-and-explainability-tools) above.*\n\nSelbst, Andrew D., and Solon Barocas. \"[The intuitive appeal of explainable machines](https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/flr87&div=44&g_sent=&collection=journals).\" *Fordham L.

Overall it is fairly pessimistic about explanations and what might be possible, suggesting more process or value-based documentation instead of model explanations.\n\nColaner, Nathan. \u201cIs explainable artificial intelligence intrinsically valuable?\u201d *AI & SOCIETY* 37 (2021): 231-238.\n\n> Essay paper arguing that explainability is intrinsically valuable, not just to enable debugging, improve human-AI collaboration, or support human supervision and appeals. The paper argues that explainability is valuable and needed for human dignity, to understand what is happening to oneself, for participation and inclusion in society, and procedural justice. This encourages to have a broader view of explainability in machine learning.\n\nAlkhatib, Ali, and Michael Bernstein. \"[Street-level algorithms: A theory at the gaps between policy and decisions](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300760).\" In *Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*, pp. 1-13. 2019.\n\n> Essay paper with three examples suggesting to use the idea of street-level bureaucracy (bureaucrats who make local decisions with some flexibility when administering the law) to explain some friction in rolling out automated decision making, especially when it comes to outliers and novel situations that bureaucrats and react can detect while ML automation does not. Even though the paper talks little about solutions or scale challenges, this may provide some nuanced insight into human-in-the-loop design of any software automation, not just machine learning.\n\nCai, Carrie J., Samantha Winter, David Steiner, Lauren Wilcox, and Michael Terry. \"[\u2019Hello AI\u2019: Uncovering the Onboarding Needs of Medical Practitioners for Human-AI Collaborative Decision-Making](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3359206).\" *Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction* 3, no. CSCW (2019): 1-24.\n\n> Interesting overall discussion about what information users (in this case medical practitioners) need to trust and adopt an ML model\u2019s predictions, based on an study with pathologists. For example, need to convey a mental model of how the AI works, need to explain what data was used to train the model and what features it uses (visible and not visible in UI) to gain trust.

Somewhat dry and not really specific to ML at all, but useful framing and illustration of what accountability means in different contexts.\n\n## 13. Human-AI Interaction\n\n*This area is interesting and has seen significant attention recently, but goes beyond my typical software engineering considerations. See the [Human-AI Interaction](http://www.humanaiclass.org/) class at CMU for more pointers.*\n\nYang, Qian. \"[The role of design in creating machine-learning-enhanced user experience](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS17/paper/viewPaper/15363).\" In *2017 AAAI Spring Symposium Series*. 2017.\n\n> Excellent position paper arguing that currently most AI-enabled systems are driven by data availability rather than a vision for a product, leading to poor user experiences. Argues for the importance of designing the user interaction before or with developing the model, which needs AI literacy from UI designers and interdisciplinary collaboration. Has several good pointers to literature for going deeper.\n\nKocielnik, Rafal, Saleema Amershi, and Paul N. Bennett. \"[Will you accept an imperfect AI?

They distinguish intrinsic trust which requires that a user\u2019s prior believe align with how the model reasons (here explanations and capability tests are useful) and extrinsic trust from a positive track record in production or a rigorous evaluation as the two key directions to increase trust. They specifically talk about how adhering to partial contracts may be sufficient to establish trust, but remain somewhat vague on the concept beyond some vague references to subpopulations and capabilities.\n\n## 14. Computational Notebooks\n\n*There is quite a bit of work on computational notebooks recently, mostly \nfocused on the exploratory work that data scientists perform. Some of this\nis focused on poor software engineering practices, e.g., with regard to\ntesting, modularity, reuse, versioning, dependency management, and determinism. \nMany papers in this area study pain points and suggest new tooling extensions.*\n\nPimentel, Joao Felipe, Leonardo Murta, Vanessa Braganholo, and Juliana Freire. \"[A large-scale study about quality and reproducibility of Jupyter notebooks](http://www2.ic.uff.br/~leomurta/papers/pimentel2019a.pdf).\" In 2019 IEEE/ACM 16th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), pp. 507-517.

See the [Human-AI Interaction](http://www.humanaiclass.org/) class at CMU for more pointers.*\n\nYang, Qian. \"[The role of design in creating machine-learning-enhanced user experience](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS17/paper/viewPaper/15363).\" In *2017 AAAI Spring Symposium Series*. 2017.\n\n> Excellent position paper arguing that currently most AI-enabled systems are driven by data availability rather than a vision for a product, leading to poor user experiences. Argues for the importance of designing the user interaction before or with developing the model, which needs AI literacy from UI designers and interdisciplinary collaboration. Has several good pointers to literature for going deeper.\n\nKocielnik, Rafal, Saleema Amershi, and Paul N. Bennett. \"[Will you accept an imperfect AI? Exploring designs for adjusting end-user expectations of AI systems](http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI2019/1proc/paper411.pdf).\" In *Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*, pp. 1-14. 2019.\n\n> Cool mturk-style study to explore different means of setting expectations for users that the ML predictions of the system might be occasionally wrong. This is useful to think at the system level about mitigations for incorrect predictions, here focusing on how to present them to users.

Very explicit about design goals and decisions; lots of pointers to related work on mental models and debugging for end users.\n\nJacovi, Alon, Ana Marasovi\u0107, Tim Miller, and Yoav Goldberg. \"[Formalizing trust in artificial intelligence: Prerequisites, causes and goals of human trust in AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07487).\" Proc. FAccT (2021).\n\n> Interesting conceptual discussion trying to define trust and trustworthiness, including an important recognition that risk is necessary for trust. They distinguish intrinsic trust which requires that a user\u2019s prior believe align with how the model reasons (here explanations and capability tests are useful) and extrinsic trust from a positive track record in production or a rigorous evaluation as the two key directions to increase trust. They specifically talk about how adhering to partial contracts may be sufficient to establish trust, but remain somewhat vague on the concept beyond some vague references to subpopulations and capabilities.\n\n## 14. Computational Notebooks\n\n*There is quite a bit of work on computational notebooks recently, mostly \nfocused on the exploratory work that data scientists perform. Some of this\nis focused on poor software engineering practices, e.g., with regard to\ntesting, modularity, reuse, versioning, dependency management, and determinism. \nMany papers in this area study pain points and suggest new tooling extensions.*\n\nPimentel, Joao Felipe, Leonardo Murta, Vanessa Braganholo, and Juliana Freire. \"[A large-scale study about quality and reproducibility of Jupyter notebooks](http://www2.ic.uff.br/~leomurta/papers/pimentel2019a.pdf).\" In 2019 IEEE/ACM 16th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), pp. 507-517.

Lots of statistics on usage and trends, sometimes a bit shallow but at a massive scale: for example, that most notebooks use only few libraries, that there are huge numbers of notebook authors, and that static analysis seems feasible.\n\n\nKery, Mary Beth, Marissa Radensky, Mahima Arya, Bonnie E. John, and Brad A. Myers. \"[The story in the notebook: Exploratory data science using a literate programming tool](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3173574.3173748).\" In Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-11. 2018.\n\n> Interview study with Jupyter users to understand their practices and challenges, highlighting especially the exploratory nature and the challenges with regard to cleaning up work and versioning. Subsequent work by the same authors suggested versioning tooling.\n\nChattopadhyay, Souti, Ishita Prasad, Austin Z.

Not only covering notebooks, but similar results to the more recent studies: Tracking rationale in exploratory programming is a key challenge, no abstraction, little reuse, negative results get lost; data scientists have different profiles from developers but often work with them; data scientists rarely collaborate with other data scientists.\n\nHead, Andrew, Fred Hohman, Titus Barik, Steven M.

Machine Learning Libraries and APIs\n\n*Software engineers like to study library adoption and challenges in using libraries and APIs. There are several papers that look specifically at APIs related to machine learning. Potentially useful when trying to understand the technical environment provided for data scientists.*\n\nZhang, Yuhao, Yifan Chen, Shing-Chi Cheung, Yingfei Xiong, and Lu Zhang. \"[An empirical study on TensorFlow program bugs](https://doi.org/10.1145/3213846.3213866).\" In Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis, pp. 129-140. 2018.\n\nZhang, Tianyi, Cuiyun Gao, Lei Ma, Michael R. Lyu, and Miryung Kim. \"[An empirical study of common challenges in developing deep learning applications](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~miryung/Publications/isese2019-deeplearningchallenge.pdf).\" In The 30th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE). 2019.\n\n> These two papers are examples of papers that analyzes public bug reports from issue trackers or question-answer sites (stackoverflow) for machine-learning frameworks. They characterize the kinds of problems developers and users tend to have, some some solutions. Many issues seem to be common framework issues, such as documentation issues and breaking APIs. Some challenges, such as probabilistic correctness and missing debuggers, seem more ML specific.\n\nDilhara, Malinda, Ameya Ketkar, and Danny Dig. \"[Understanding Software-2.0: a study of machine learning library usage and evolution](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3453478).\" *ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)* 30, no. 4 (2021): 1-42.\n\n> Analysis of how machine learning libraries are used in popular Python code on GitHub, complementary to past studies of library use in notebooks (see Computational Notebooks section above). Focuses on how libraries are updated, finding many of the same challenges as with other library evolution and breaking changes in non-ML libraries. Interesting brief survey with answers from 28 project maintainers that introduced machine learning late in the project, indicating applications that use ML for a new feature or to replace some prior code.\n\nIslam, Md Johirul, Hoan Anh Nguyen, Rangeet Pan, and Hridesh Rajan. \"[What do developers ask about ML libraries? A large-scale study using stack overflow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11940).\" *arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11940* (2019).\n\n> Large scale of stackoverflow questions related to 10 machine learning frameworks. Largely quantitative reporting, for example, which stages are most covered in those questions.\n\nChen, Zhenpeng, Yanbin Cao, Yuanqiang Liu, Haoyu Wang, Tao Xie, and Xuanzhe Liu. \"[Understanding Challenges in Deploying Deep Learning Based Software: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00760).\" Proc. FSE (2020).\n\n> Another StackOverflow study, this time focused on questions that developers ask regarding deploying deep learning models. Mostly API/documentation style questions close to the model rather than broader system deployment or MLOps questions and fairly shallow insights, but still potentially useful to see what developers struggle with current infrastructure at the API level. \n\n## 16. Misc\n\n*Various recommended and useful resources that do not fit well into the other categories.*\n\nHopkins, Aspen, and Serena Booth. \"[Machine Learning Practices Outside Big Tech: How Resource Constraints Challenge Responsible Development](http://www.slbooth.com/papers/AIES-2021_Hopkins_and_Booth.pdf).\" In Proceedings of the 2021 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AIES \u201921) (2021).\n\n> Very interesting interview studies with 17 participants from organizations building ML products outside of Big Tech companies, showing a wide range of challenges. The initial focus is on model fairness, but it shows how resource constraints influence many design decisions and tradeoffs and create many pain points in teams. Focused mostly on model development, not the larger system.\n\nMart\u00ednez-Fern\u00e1ndez, Silverio, Justus Bogner, Xavier Franch, Marc Oriol, Julien Siebert, Adam Trendowicz, Anna Maria Vollmer, and Stefan Wagner. \"[Software Engineering for AI-Based Systems: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01984).\" *arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01984* (2021).\n\n> Incredibly ambitious and broad survey, covering all of software engineering for systems with AI components (not just model building and deployment). The scope is so wide that it won\u2019t cover all papers in this area, often just selecting a few papers for a field with lots of research and tools (and they exclude grey literature), but it provides a very good overview and puts a lot of effort in organizing the literature.\n\nAmeisen, Emmanuel. \"Building Machine Learning Powered Applications: Going From Idea to Product.\" O'Reilly Media, 2020.\n\n> Nice book that takes a wider view of building ML applications than most, starting with discussing product goals (not just ML model goals) and going up to deployment and monitoring. It mostly stays fairly close to the model with more detailed content on the ML pipeline (including guidance for quality assurance and debugging), whereas the coverage of requirements engineering and deployment is more high-level and shallow. Overall a nice book with a healthy engineering attitude and a view that exceeds beyond the ML model.\n\nZinkevich, Martin. 2017 \u201c[Rules of Machine Learning: Best Practices for ML Engineering](http://martin.zinkevich.org/rules_of_ml/rules_of_ml.pdf).\u201d\n\n> Blog post.

The core of the paper is about deciding how much test data is needed and when it needs to be replaced. The CI framing seems rather incidental or even misleading though, as the key problem does not relate to regression testing but toward deciding whether a model outperforms another.\n\nPei, Kexin, Yinzhi Cao, Junfeng Yang, and Suman Jana. \"[DeepXplore: Automated whitebox testing of deep learning systems](https://doi.org/10.1145/3132747.3132785.).\" In proceedings of the 26th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, pp. 1-18. 2017. \n\n> Differential testing between multiple models (e.g., learned from the same data with different parameters) and input generation that aims to identify inputs that have different outputs across the models.

Shankar Sastry. \"[Towards verified artificial intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08514).\" arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08514 (2016).\n\n> Good framing why formal verification (or really any form of testing) is so difficult in machine learning systems in the first two sections: We neither have a specification, nor a good grasp of the environment, and in addition the system is often evolving itself. After explaining why it is so difficult, the paper points to several potentially interesting research areas, but none of them seem to overcome the fundamental problems, especially that of missing specifications.\n\nTramer, Florian, Vaggelis Atlidakis, Roxana Geambasu, Daniel Hsu, Jean-Pierre Hubaux, Mathias Humbert, Ari Juels, and Huang Lin. \"[FairTest: Discovering unwarranted associations in data-driven applications](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/249325231.pdf).\" In 2017 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P), pp. 401-416. IEEE, 2017.\n\n> Approach to explore correlations between protected attributes and prediction outcomes in *subpopulations* of the dataset. The key idea is that there may not be such a correlation (generalizes to various fairness measures on the confusion matrix) for the entire population, but it may well exists for certain subpopulations, e.g., only among low-income residence do we observe gender-based discrimination. The key contribution is an efficient search among subpopulations inspired by decision tree learning algorithms. Explicitly adopts testing and debugging terminology and goes beyond the simple invariants (anti-classification) in many other fairness testing papers, i.e., it can account for unfairness through correlated attributes.\n\n## 3. Debugging and Explainability Tools\n\n*How do we understand what a model does and why it is wrong? Debugging seems closely related with the quest for interpretability, even if just through approximations. This can focus on the model as well as on the data or the learning algorithm. (Some interpretability/explanability papers are listed in the [Transparency](#12-transparency-accountability-and-policy) section below, because they focus on how end user rather than developers understand explanations.)*\n\nMolnar, Christoph. \"[Interpretable machine learning. A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)\", 2019. \n\n> Though primarily about interpretability, this book provides a great overview of techniques to understand and debug models. \nThe book covers both inherently interpretable models and many techniques for ex-post explanations inferred from blackbox models. Explanations can be shown to the user (though the book is fairly shallow on the challenges of doing this and larger system design questions), but they also seem very useful in understanding model (mis-)behavior, understanding individual wrong predictions and outliers. The book covers both techniques for understanding the model and understanding characteristics of the training data. Written in a fairly accessible and pragmatic style, covering the important math but also providing good intutions.\n\nLipton, Zachary C. \"[The Mythos of Model Interpretability: In machine learning, the concept of interpretability is both important and slippery](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3236386.3241340).\" *Queue* 16, no. 3 (2018): 31-57.\n\n> Good and compact overview of different goals and notions of explainablity, interpretability, trust, and transparency and a quick overview of different techniques in this area.\n\nBhatt, Umang, Alice Xiang, Shubham Sharma, Adrian Weller, Ankur Taly, Yunhan Jia, Joydeep Ghosh, Ruchir Puri, Jos\u00e9 MF Moura, and Peter Eckersley. \"[Explainable machine learning in deployment](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3351095.3375624).\" In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, pp. 648-657. 2020.\n\n> An interview study asking practioners about how they use explainability techniques.

Fairness\n\n*Much of the interesting fairness discussions are really about requirements engineering in my book. Once a fairness measure and protected attributes are defined, measurement is typically not very challenging. The challenge is in identifying what notion of fairness is appropriate, a typical requirements engineering problem (and process challenge) negotiating the demands of various stakeholders. Here are a couple of papers that I liked.*\n\nCorbett-Davies, Sam, and Sharad Goel. \"[The measure and mismeasure of fairness: A critical review of fair machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00023).\" arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00023 (2018).\n\n> A comprehensive an critical discussion of different fairness measures often discussed in the ML community. It's kind of depressing how many different notions and problems there are and how few solutions. Even though they don't discuss requirements engineering in the paper, I put it here because it shows the complicated mess that fairness makes when trying to identify the right fairness requirements for an ML-enabled system. A requirements engineer must work with stakeholders to identify suitable requirements and make a lot of decisions, which won't be easy but will be necessary. This paper will probably give the requirements engineer the right vocabulary to talk to ML experts who need to assure the requirement and will provide enough pointers to identify what issues to probe for when talking to stakeholders.\n\nHolstein, Kenneth, Jennifer Wortman Vaughan, Hal Daum\u00e9 III, Miro Dudik, and Hanna Wallach. \"[Improving fairness in machine learning systems: What do industry practitioners need?](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/docs/daume19fairness.pdf)\" In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-16. 2019.\n\n> An interview study with engineers that consider fairness in their ML-enabled products. This one looks at the system/software-engineering level, beyond narrow fairness properties at the model level and discusses problems and strategies broadly, including fairness considerations across all lifecycle stages, possible checklists, best practices, holistic auditing, possibly even resulting in changes in system design.

Safety & Robustness\n\n*There is a significant amount of machine learning research on safety and security, especially on narrow properties of robustness, but also some system-level discussions on safeguard mechanisms outside of the model. A software engineering professional should probably understand the tools and techniques. Many testing papers in the section Quality Assurance above cover robustness properties.*\n\nBorg, Markus, Cristofer Englund, Krzysztof Wnuk, Boris Duran, Christoffer Levandowski, Shenjian Gao, Yanwen Tan, Henrik Kaijser, Henrik L\u00f6nn, and Jonas T\u00f6rnqvist. \"[Safely entering the deep: A review of verification and validation for machine learning and a challenge elicitation in the automotive industry](https://www.atlantis-press.com/journals/jase/125905766).\" Journal of Automotive Software Engineering.

This is one of the more readable papers in this area that I have seen, but I'm not aware of any paper that really discusses how to use these robustness guarantees in production (typical scenarios seem to be to test robustness for a training set, for a set of important test cases, or to test it at runtime to make sure that a specific result is not just caused by a pertubation) and whether the considered pertubations are relevant or interesing for practical cases.\n\n\nCohen, Jeremy M., Elan Rosenfeld, and J.

Interdisciplinary Teams\n\n*Building software systems with machine learning components requires expertise in several domains, almost always by bringing together people with different backgrounds in interdisciplinary teams.

See the [Human-AI Interaction](http://www.humanaiclass.org/) class at CMU for more pointers.*\n\nYang, Qian. \"[The role of design in creating machine-learning-enhanced user experience](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS17/paper/viewPaper/15363).\" In *2017 AAAI Spring Symposium Series*. 2017.\n\n> Excellent position paper arguing that currently most AI-enabled systems are driven by data availability rather than a vision for a product, leading to poor user experiences. Argues for the importance of designing the user interaction before or with developing the model, which needs AI literacy from UI designers and interdisciplinary collaboration. Has several good pointers to literature for going deeper.\n\nKocielnik, Rafal, Saleema Amershi, and Paul N. Bennett. \"[Will you accept an imperfect AI? Exploring designs for adjusting end-user expectations of AI systems](http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI2019/1proc/paper411.pdf).\" In *Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*, pp. 1-14. 2019.\n\n> Cool mturk-style study to explore different means of setting expectations for users that the ML predictions of the system might be occasionally wrong. This is useful to think at the system level about mitigations for incorrect predictions, here focusing on how to present them to users.

Very explicit about design goals and decisions; lots of pointers to related work on mental models and debugging for end users.\n\nJacovi, Alon, Ana Marasovi\u0107, Tim Miller, and Yoav Goldberg. \"[Formalizing trust in artificial intelligence: Prerequisites, causes and goals of human trust in AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07487).\" Proc. FAccT (2021).\n\n> Interesting conceptual discussion trying to define trust and trustworthiness, including an important recognition that risk is necessary for trust. They distinguish intrinsic trust which requires that a user\u2019s prior believe align with how the model reasons (here explanations and capability tests are useful) and extrinsic trust from a positive track record in production or a rigorous evaluation as the two key directions to increase trust. They specifically talk about how adhering to partial contracts may be sufficient to establish trust, but remain somewhat vague on the concept beyond some vague references to subpopulations and capabilities.\n\n## 14. Computational Notebooks\n\n*There is quite a bit of work on computational notebooks recently, mostly \nfocused on the exploratory work that data scientists perform. Some of this\nis focused on poor software engineering practices, e.g., with regard to\ntesting, modularity, reuse, versioning, dependency management, and determinism. \nMany papers in this area study pain points and suggest new tooling extensions.*\n\nPimentel, Joao Felipe, Leonardo Murta, Vanessa Braganholo, and Juliana Freire. \"[A large-scale study about quality and reproducibility of Jupyter notebooks](http://www2.ic.uff.br/~leomurta/papers/pimentel2019a.pdf).\" In 2019 IEEE/ACM 16th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), pp. 507-517.

Lots of statistics on usage and trends, sometimes a bit shallow but at a massive scale: for example, that most notebooks use only few libraries, that there are huge numbers of notebook authors, and that static analysis seems feasible.\n\n\nKery, Mary Beth, Marissa Radensky, Mahima Arya, Bonnie E. John, and Brad A. Myers. \"[The story in the notebook: Exploratory data science using a literate programming tool](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3173574.3173748).\" In Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-11. 2018.\n\n> Interview study with Jupyter users to understand their practices and challenges, highlighting especially the exploratory nature and the challenges with regard to cleaning up work and versioning. Subsequent work by the same authors suggested versioning tooling.\n\nChattopadhyay, Souti, Ishita Prasad, Austin Z.

Not only covering notebooks, but similar results to the more recent studies: Tracking rationale in exploratory programming is a key challenge, no abstraction, little reuse, negative results get lost; data scientists have different profiles from developers but often work with them; data scientists rarely collaborate with other data scientists.\n\nHead, Andrew, Fred Hohman, Titus Barik, Steven M.

Machine Learning Libraries and APIs\n\n*Software engineers like to study library adoption and challenges in using libraries and APIs. There are several papers that look specifically at APIs related to machine learning. Potentially useful when trying to understand the technical environment provided for data scientists.*\n\nZhang, Yuhao, Yifan Chen, Shing-Chi Cheung, Yingfei Xiong, and Lu Zhang. \"[An empirical study on TensorFlow program bugs](https://doi.org/10.1145/3213846.3213866).\" In Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis, pp. 129-140. 2018.\n\nZhang, Tianyi, Cuiyun Gao, Lei Ma, Michael R. Lyu, and Miryung Kim. \"[An empirical study of common challenges in developing deep learning applications](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~miryung/Publications/isese2019-deeplearningchallenge.pdf).\" In The 30th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE). 2019.\n\n> These two papers are examples of papers that analyzes public bug reports from issue trackers or question-answer sites (stackoverflow) for machine-learning frameworks. They characterize the kinds of problems developers and users tend to have, some some solutions. Many issues seem to be common framework issues, such as documentation issues and breaking APIs. Some challenges, such as probabilistic correctness and missing debuggers, seem more ML specific.\n\nDilhara, Malinda, Ameya Ketkar, and Danny Dig. \"[Understanding Software-2.0: a study of machine learning library usage and evolution](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3453478).\" *ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)* 30, no. 4 (2021): 1-42.\n\n> Analysis of how machine learning libraries are used in popular Python code on GitHub, complementary to past studies of library use in notebooks (see Computational Notebooks section above). Focuses on how libraries are updated, finding many of the same challenges as with other library evolution and breaking changes in non-ML libraries. Interesting brief survey with answers from 28 project maintainers that introduced machine learning late in the project, indicating applications that use ML for a new feature or to replace some prior code.\n\nIslam, Md Johirul, Hoan Anh Nguyen, Rangeet Pan, and Hridesh Rajan. \"[What do developers ask about ML libraries? A large-scale study using stack overflow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11940).\" *arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11940* (2019).\n\n> Large scale of stackoverflow questions related to 10 machine learning frameworks. Largely quantitative reporting, for example, which stages are most covered in those questions.\n\nChen, Zhenpeng, Yanbin Cao, Yuanqiang Liu, Haoyu Wang, Tao Xie, and Xuanzhe Liu. \"[Understanding Challenges in Deploying Deep Learning Based Software: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00760).\" Proc. FSE (2020).\n\n> Another StackOverflow study, this time focused on questions that developers ask regarding deploying deep learning models. Mostly API/documentation style questions close to the model rather than broader system deployment or MLOps questions and fairly shallow insights, but still potentially useful to see what developers struggle with current infrastructure at the API level. \n\n## 16. Misc\n\n*Various recommended and useful resources that do not fit well into the other categories.*\n\nHopkins, Aspen, and Serena Booth. \"[Machine Learning Practices Outside Big Tech: How Resource Constraints Challenge Responsible Development](http://www.slbooth.com/papers/AIES-2021_Hopkins_and_Booth.pdf).\" In Proceedings of the 2021 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AIES \u201921) (2021).\n\n> Very interesting interview studies with 17 participants from organizations building ML products outside of Big Tech companies, showing a wide range of challenges. The initial focus is on model fairness, but it shows how resource constraints influence many design decisions and tradeoffs and create many pain points in teams. Focused mostly on model development, not the larger system.\n\nMart\u00ednez-Fern\u00e1ndez, Silverio, Justus Bogner, Xavier Franch, Marc Oriol, Julien Siebert, Adam Trendowicz, Anna Maria Vollmer, and Stefan Wagner. \"[Software Engineering for AI-Based Systems: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01984).\" *arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01984* (2021).\n\n> Incredibly ambitious and broad survey, covering all of software engineering for systems with AI components (not just model building and deployment). The scope is so wide that it won\u2019t cover all papers in this area, often just selecting a few papers for a field with lots of research and tools (and they exclude grey literature), but it provides a very good overview and puts a lot of effort in organizing the literature.\n\nAmeisen, Emmanuel. \"Building Machine Learning Powered Applications: Going From Idea to Product.\" O'Reilly Media, 2020.\n\n> Nice book that takes a wider view of building ML applications than most, starting with discussing product goals (not just ML model goals) and going up to deployment and monitoring. It mostly stays fairly close to the model with more detailed content on the ML pipeline (including guidance for quality assurance and debugging), whereas the coverage of requirements engineering and deployment is more high-level and shallow. Overall a nice book with a healthy engineering attitude and a view that exceeds beyond the ML model.\n\nZinkevich, Martin. 2017 \u201c[Rules of Machine Learning: Best Practices for ML Engineering](http://martin.zinkevich.org/rules_of_ml/rules_of_ml.pdf).\u201d\n\n> Blog post.

Safety & Robustness\n\n*There is a significant amount of machine learning research on safety and security, especially on narrow properties of robustness, but also some system-level discussions on safeguard mechanisms outside of the model. A software engineering professional should probably understand the tools and techniques. Many testing papers in the section Quality Assurance above cover robustness properties.*\n\nBorg, Markus, Cristofer Englund, Krzysztof Wnuk, Boris Duran, Christoffer Levandowski, Shenjian Gao, Yanwen Tan, Henrik Kaijser, Henrik L\u00f6nn, and Jonas T\u00f6rnqvist. \"[Safely entering the deep: A review of verification and validation for machine learning and a challenge elicitation in the automotive industry](https://www.atlantis-press.com/journals/jase/125905766).\" Journal of Automotive Software Engineering.

The search space by these pertubations and their combinations is typically very large and formal methods are used to produce conservative results (i.e., when it reports robustness against these pertubations it actually guaranteed to always return the same prediction, but there can be false positives). This is one of the more readable papers in this area that I have seen, but I'm not aware of any paper that really discusses how to use these robustness guarantees in production (typical scenarios seem to be to test robustness for a training set, for a set of important test cases, or to test it at runtime to make sure that a specific result is not just caused by a pertubation) and whether the considered pertubations are relevant or interesing for practical cases.\n\n\nCohen, Jeremy M., Elan Rosenfeld, and J.

Shows lots of frustration and miscommunication and lots of surprises about data quality, often grounded in miscalibrated expectations. The projects were usually much more exploratory that customers were used too and IBM had difficulty providing enough experts for the technology; customer expectations were inappropriate due to hype and marketing; lots of adoption and system-level challenges. The study is based on interviews with managers at companies and IBM consultants and uses a sensemaking framing. It is rather challenging to read, but the results section is interesting.\n\n## 12. Transparency, Accountability, and Policy\n\n*Discussions of explanations as they relate to end users and policies, in contrast to explanations and explainability tools that developers might use for debugging discussed in [Debugging](#3-debugging-and-explainability-tools) above.*\n\nSelbst, Andrew D., and Solon Barocas. \"[The intuitive appeal of explainable machines](https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/flr87&div=44&g_sent=&collection=journals).\" *Fordham L. Rev.* 87 (2018): 1085.\n\n> A great overview of how explainability has traditionally been discussed in laws and the reasons for it (including values) and challenges around it, including the need to rely on intuitive explanations and the challenges that come with it. Overall it is fairly pessimistic about explanations and what might be possible, suggesting more process or value-based documentation instead of model explanations.\n\nColaner, Nathan. \u201cIs explainable artificial intelligence intrinsically valuable?\u201d *AI & SOCIETY* 37 (2021): 231-238.\n\n> Essay paper arguing that explainability is intrinsically valuable, not just to enable debugging, improve human-AI collaboration, or support human supervision and appeals. The paper argues that explainability is valuable and needed for human dignity, to understand what is happening to oneself, for participation and inclusion in society, and procedural justice. This encourages to have a broader view of explainability in machine learning.\n\nAlkhatib, Ali, and Michael Bernstein. \"[Street-level algorithms: A theory at the gaps between policy and decisions](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300760).\" In *Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*, pp. 1-13. 2019.\n\n> Essay paper with three examples suggesting to use the idea of street-level bureaucracy (bureaucrats who make local decisions with some flexibility when administering the law) to explain some friction in rolling out automated decision making, especially when it comes to outliers and novel situations that bureaucrats and react can detect while ML automation does not. Even though the paper talks little about solutions or scale challenges, this may provide some nuanced insight into human-in-the-loop design of any software automation, not just machine learning.\n\nCai, Carrie J., Samantha Winter, David Steiner, Lauren Wilcox, and Michael Terry. \"[\u2019Hello AI\u2019: Uncovering the Onboarding Needs of Medical Practitioners for Human-AI Collaborative Decision-Making](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3359206).\" *Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction* 3, no. CSCW (2019): 1-24.\n\n> Interesting overall discussion about what information users (in this case medical practitioners) need to trust and adopt an ML model\u2019s predictions, based on an study with pathologists.

Somewhat dry and not really specific to ML at all, but useful framing and illustration of what accountability means in different contexts.\n\n## 13. Human-AI Interaction\n\n*This area is interesting and has seen significant attention recently, but goes beyond my typical software engineering considerations. See the [Human-AI Interaction](http://www.humanaiclass.org/) class at CMU for more pointers.*\n\nYang, Qian. \"[The role of design in creating machine-learning-enhanced user experience](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS17/paper/viewPaper/15363).\" In *2017 AAAI Spring Symposium Series*. 2017.\n\n> Excellent position paper arguing that currently most AI-enabled systems are driven by data availability rather than a vision for a product, leading to poor user experiences. Argues for the importance of designing the user interaction before or with developing the model, which needs AI literacy from UI designers and interdisciplinary collaboration. Has several good pointers to literature for going deeper.\n\nKocielnik, Rafal, Saleema Amershi, and Paul N. Bennett. \"[Will you accept an imperfect AI?

They distinguish intrinsic trust which requires that a user\u2019s prior believe align with how the model reasons (here explanations and capability tests are useful) and extrinsic trust from a positive track record in production or a rigorous evaluation as the two key directions to increase trust. They specifically talk about how adhering to partial contracts may be sufficient to establish trust, but remain somewhat vague on the concept beyond some vague references to subpopulations and capabilities.\n\n## 14. Computational Notebooks\n\n*There is quite a bit of work on computational notebooks recently, mostly \nfocused on the exploratory work that data scientists perform. Some of this\nis focused on poor software engineering practices, e.g., with regard to\ntesting, modularity, reuse, versioning, dependency management, and determinism. \nMany papers in this area study pain points and suggest new tooling extensions.*\n\nPimentel, Joao Felipe, Leonardo Murta, Vanessa Braganholo, and Juliana Freire. \"[A large-scale study about quality and reproducibility of Jupyter notebooks](http://www2.ic.uff.br/~leomurta/papers/pimentel2019a.pdf).\" In 2019 IEEE/ACM 16th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), pp. 507-517.

They characterize the kinds of problems developers and users tend to have, some some solutions. Many issues seem to be common framework issues, such as documentation issues and breaking APIs. Some challenges, such as probabilistic correctness and missing debuggers, seem more ML specific.\n\nDilhara, Malinda, Ameya Ketkar, and Danny Dig. \"[Understanding Software-2.0: a study of machine learning library usage and evolution](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3453478).\" *ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)* 30, no. 4 (2021): 1-42.\n\n> Analysis of how machine learning libraries are used in popular Python code on GitHub, complementary to past studies of library use in notebooks (see Computational Notebooks section above). Focuses on how libraries are updated, finding many of the same challenges as with other library evolution and breaking changes in non-ML libraries.

Model Invariants\n\nSegura, Sergio, Gordon Fraser, Ana B. Sanchez, and Antonio Ruiz-Cort\u00e9s. \"[A survey on metamorphic testing](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/74235918.pdf).\" IEEE Transactions on software engineering 42, no. 9 (2016): 805-824.\n\n> This paper discusses the idea of metamorphic testing and summarizes much work in this area. The key idea is that in the absence of a specification about what the model should do (which is the whole point of using ML), we might still be able to give partial specifications in terms of invariants about how outputs should relate for input pairs. For example, robustness conditions might be expressed by indicating that similar inputs should produce the same output or that linearly scaling all features or adding irrelevant features should not affect the outcome for certain classifiers. This is an interesting direction that enables testing of a number of invariants for ML models. The paper gives many pointers to other work in this area.\n\n\nRibeiro, Marco Tulio, Sameer Singh, and Carlos Guestrin. \"[Semantically equivalent adversarial rules for debugging NLP models](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1079.pdf).\" In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 856-865. 2018.\n\n> Example of testing for invariants in NLP models (in line with metamorphic testing, even though they do not refer to that concept). Here one expects certain linguistic invariants, for example, replacing \"isn't\" by \"is not\" should not change the outcome. These invariants are used to derive and prioritize tests and to then improve the model with more input data.\n\nSingh, Gagandeep, Timon Gehr, Markus P\u00fcschel, and Martin Vechev. \"[An abstract domain for certifying neural networks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3290354).\" Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages 3, no. POPL (2019): 1-30.\n\n> This is an example of a large group of paper that proofs specific invariants about models. For example, the specification could be that a model is robust to certain changes to its inputs (e.g., changing the brightness of pixels by +/- 20%) on the training set or certain classes of inputs. In contrast to much testing work, here results are verified over all input changes covered by a specification.\n\nGalhotra, Sainyam, Yuriy Brun, and Alexandra Meliou. \"[Fairness testing: testing software for discrimination](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3106237.3106277).\" In Proceedings of the 2017 11th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering, pp. 498-510. 2017.\n\n> Another application of testing invariants: here, for fairness certain outputs should be independent of changes to sensitive attributes. To simple for practical use in my book; limited to \"fairness through blindness\" (or \"unawareness\" or \"anti-classification\") and group fairness (but seemingly without addressing correlations in the data, since samples are generated uniformly).\n\n\nDing, J., D.

The paper identifies rules that, with high probability, are sufficient to explain a specific prediction for a subset of all inputs. These invariants can then explain part of the model and could potentially be used as partial specifications or test cases.\n\nKang, Daniel, Deepti Raghavan, Peter Bailis, and Matei Zaharia. \"[Model Assertions for Monitoring and Improving ML Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01668).\" In Proceedings of MLSys 2020.\n\n> Discusses use cases of \u201csoft\u201d assertions or invariants that show inconsistencies, especially across time series data and across multiple classifiers, without having to have access to labels. Table 5 in the appendix has a very good overview of different invariants and the paper discusses several plausible examples. Note that these invariants are probabilistic in nature rather than hard tests. This can be used for testing and runtime monitoring (e.g., runtime adaptation and safety mechanisms) without the need for labels! Unfortunately, the paper is very vague about concrete interfaces and technical details and focuses primarily on ML details for additional active learning and weak supervision use cases.\n\nSalay, Rick, and Krzysztof Czarnecki. \"Improving ML safety with partial specifications.\" In *International Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability, and Security*, pp. 288-300. Springer, Cham, 2019.\n\n> Good discussion of why providing specifications for ML models is infeasible, followed by a somewhat abstract but well argued discussion of how partial specifications may be used in many different ways regardless. The discussion, while fairly abstract, covers several different facts, including suggesting that some specifications may be feasible on learned intermediate representations, that probabilistic constraints may be provided for data, that partial specifications may be provided for how to safely process model outputs, or that partial  specifications may be encoded during training.\n\n\n### 2.5.

Nice demonstration of the idea, though it is not clear how far this would be practical beyond fairly simple learning algorithms implemented in student projects.\n\nXie, Xiaoyuan, Joshua WK Ho, Christian Murphy, Gail Kaiser, Baowen Xu, and Tsong Yueh Chen. \"[Testing and validating machine learning classifiers by metamorphic testing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121210003213).\" Journal of Systems and Software 84, no. 4 (2011): 544-558.\n\n> This paper applies metamorphic relations to the learning framework itself.

The core of the paper is about deciding how much test data is needed and when it needs to be replaced. The CI framing seems rather incidental or even misleading though, as the key problem does not relate to regression testing but toward deciding whether a model outperforms another.\n\nPei, Kexin, Yinzhi Cao, Junfeng Yang, and Suman Jana. \"[DeepXplore: Automated whitebox testing of deep learning systems](https://doi.org/10.1145/3132747.3132785.).\" In proceedings of the 26th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, pp. 1-18. 2017. \n\n> Differential testing between multiple models (e.g., learned from the same data with different parameters) and input generation that aims to identify inputs that have different outputs across the models.

The key idea is that there may not be such a correlation (generalizes to various fairness measures on the confusion matrix) for the entire population, but it may well exists for certain subpopulations, e.g., only among low-income residence do we observe gender-based discrimination. The key contribution is an efficient search among subpopulations inspired by decision tree learning algorithms. Explicitly adopts testing and debugging terminology and goes beyond the simple invariants (anti-classification) in many other fairness testing papers, i.e., it can account for unfairness through correlated attributes.\n\n## 3. Debugging and Explainability Tools\n\n*How do we understand what a model does and why it is wrong? Debugging seems closely related with the quest for interpretability, even if just through approximations. This can focus on the model as well as on the data or the learning algorithm. (Some interpretability/explanability papers are listed in the [Transparency](#12-transparency-accountability-and-policy) section below, because they focus on how end user rather than developers understand explanations.)*\n\nMolnar, Christoph. \"[Interpretable machine learning. A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)\", 2019. \n\n> Though primarily about interpretability, this book provides a great overview of techniques to understand and debug models. \nThe book covers both inherently interpretable models and many techniques for ex-post explanations inferred from blackbox models. Explanations can be shown to the user (though the book is fairly shallow on the challenges of doing this and larger system design questions), but they also seem very useful in understanding model (mis-)behavior, understanding individual wrong predictions and outliers. The book covers both techniques for understanding the model and understanding characteristics of the training data.

Fairness\n\n*Much of the interesting fairness discussions are really about requirements engineering in my book. Once a fairness measure and protected attributes are defined, measurement is typically not very challenging. The challenge is in identifying what notion of fairness is appropriate, a typical requirements engineering problem (and process challenge) negotiating the demands of various stakeholders. Here are a couple of papers that I liked.*\n\nCorbett-Davies, Sam, and Sharad Goel. \"[The measure and mismeasure of fairness: A critical review of fair machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00023).\" arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00023 (2018).\n\n> A comprehensive an critical discussion of different fairness measures often discussed in the ML community. It's kind of depressing how many different notions and problems there are and how few solutions. Even though they don't discuss requirements engineering in the paper, I put it here because it shows the complicated mess that fairness makes when trying to identify the right fairness requirements for an ML-enabled system. A requirements engineer must work with stakeholders to identify suitable requirements and make a lot of decisions, which won't be easy but will be necessary. This paper will probably give the requirements engineer the right vocabulary to talk to ML experts who need to assure the requirement and will provide enough pointers to identify what issues to probe for when talking to stakeholders.\n\nHolstein, Kenneth, Jennifer Wortman Vaughan, Hal Daum\u00e9 III, Miro Dudik, and Hanna Wallach. \"[Improving fairness in machine learning systems: What do industry practitioners need?](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/docs/daume19fairness.pdf)\" In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-16. 2019.\n\n> An interview study with engineers that consider fairness in their ML-enabled products. This one looks at the system/software-engineering level, beyond narrow fairness properties at the model level and discusses problems and strategies broadly, including fairness considerations across all lifecycle stages, possible checklists, best practices, holistic auditing, possibly even resulting in changes in system design.

Safety & Robustness\n\n*There is a significant amount of machine learning research on safety and security, especially on narrow properties of robustness, but also some system-level discussions on safeguard mechanisms outside of the model.

This is one of the more readable papers in this area that I have seen, but I'm not aware of any paper that really discusses how to use these robustness guarantees in production (typical scenarios seem to be to test robustness for a training set, for a set of important test cases, or to test it at runtime to make sure that a specific result is not just caused by a pertubation) and whether the considered pertubations are relevant or interesing for practical cases.\n\n\nCohen, Jeremy M., Elan Rosenfeld, and J.

Interdisciplinary Teams\n\n*Building software systems with machine learning components requires expertise in several domains, almost always by bringing together people with different backgrounds in interdisciplinary teams. Several papers explore how to foster such collaboration in a ML context, often with a focus on understanding particularly the interactions between data scientists and software engineers.*\n\nKim, Miryung, Thomas Zimmermann, Robert DeLine, and Andrew Begel. \"[Data scientists in software teams: State of the art and challenges](https://doi.org/10.1109/tse.2017.2754374).\" IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering 44, no. 11 (2017): 1024-1038.\n\n> Discusses the role of data scientists and their challenges through interviews and surveys.

Lots of problems arise at the interface between the ML component and the rest of the system. Engineering is often undervalued, ML is difficult to fit into the larger process, documentation at the interfaces is often a big problem, and even communication across discipline boundaries can be difficult. The paper highlights that team structures differ substantially, but that certain problems associated with certain decisions such as whether to develop the model first and then build a system around it or whether to start with the system.\n\nBusquim, Gabriel, Hugo Villamizar, Maria Julia Lima, and Marcos Kalinowski. \"[On the Interaction Between Software Engineers and Data Scientists When Building Machine Learning-Enabled Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05334).\" In *International Conference on Software Quality*, pp. 55-75.

Human-AI Interaction\n\n*This area is interesting and has seen significant attention recently, but goes beyond my typical software engineering considerations. See the [Human-AI Interaction](http://www.humanaiclass.org/) class at CMU for more pointers.*\n\nYang, Qian. \"[The role of design in creating machine-learning-enhanced user experience](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS17/paper/viewPaper/15363).\" In *2017 AAAI Spring Symposium Series*. 2017.\n\n> Excellent position paper arguing that currently most AI-enabled systems are driven by data availability rather than a vision for a product, leading to poor user experiences. Argues for the importance of designing the user interaction before or with developing the model, which needs AI literacy from UI designers and interdisciplinary collaboration. Has several good pointers to literature for going deeper.\n\nKocielnik, Rafal, Saleema Amershi, and Paul N. Bennett. \"[Will you accept an imperfect AI?

They distinguish intrinsic trust which requires that a user\u2019s prior believe align with how the model reasons (here explanations and capability tests are useful) and extrinsic trust from a positive track record in production or a rigorous evaluation as the two key directions to increase trust. They specifically talk about how adhering to partial contracts may be sufficient to establish trust, but remain somewhat vague on the concept beyond some vague references to subpopulations and capabilities.\n\n## 14. Computational Notebooks\n\n*There is quite a bit of work on computational notebooks recently, mostly \nfocused on the exploratory work that data scientists perform.

They characterize the kinds of problems developers and users tend to have, some some solutions. Many issues seem to be common framework issues, such as documentation issues and breaking APIs. Some challenges, such as probabilistic correctness and missing debuggers, seem more ML specific.\n\nDilhara, Malinda, Ameya Ketkar, and Danny Dig. \"[Understanding Software-2.0: a study of machine learning library usage and evolution](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3453478).\" *ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)* 30, no. 4 (2021): 1-42.\n\n> Analysis of how machine learning libraries are used in popular Python code on GitHub, complementary to past studies of library use in notebooks (see Computational Notebooks section above). Focuses on how libraries are updated, finding many of the same challenges as with other library evolution and breaking changes in non-ML libraries.

Requirements Engineering\n\n*I have the impression that many practical problems in building AI-enabled systems are \nreally requirements engineering problems.

Fairness\n\n*Much of the interesting fairness discussions are really about requirements engineering in my book. Once a fairness measure and protected attributes are defined, measurement is typically not very challenging. The challenge is in identifying what notion of fairness is appropriate, a typical requirements engineering problem (and process challenge) negotiating the demands of various stakeholders. Here are a couple of papers that I liked.*\n\nCorbett-Davies, Sam, and Sharad Goel. \"[The measure and mismeasure of fairness: A critical review of fair machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00023).\" arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00023 (2018).\n\n> A comprehensive an critical discussion of different fairness measures often discussed in the ML community. It's kind of depressing how many different notions and problems there are and how few solutions. Even though they don't discuss requirements engineering in the paper, I put it here because it shows the complicated mess that fairness makes when trying to identify the right fairness requirements for an ML-enabled system. A requirements engineer must work with stakeholders to identify suitable requirements and make a lot of decisions, which won't be easy but will be necessary. This paper will probably give the requirements engineer the right vocabulary to talk to ML experts who need to assure the requirement and will provide enough pointers to identify what issues to probe for when talking to stakeholders.\n\nHolstein, Kenneth, Jennifer Wortman Vaughan, Hal Daum\u00e9 III, Miro Dudik, and Hanna Wallach. \"[Improving fairness in machine learning systems: What do industry practitioners need?](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/docs/daume19fairness.pdf)\" In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-16. 2019.\n\n> An interview study with engineers that consider fairness in their ML-enabled products. This one looks at the system/software-engineering level, beyond narrow fairness properties at the model level and discusses problems and strategies broadly, including fairness considerations across all lifecycle stages, possible checklists, best practices, holistic auditing, possibly even resulting in changes in system design. It does not mention requirements, but many issues are deeply rooted in requirements engineering and system design work.\n\nMadaio, Michael A., Luke Stark, Jennifer Wortman Vaughan, and Hanna Wallach. \"[Co-Designing Checklists to Understand Organizational Challenges and Opportunities around Fairness in AI](http://www.jennwv.com/papers/checklists.pdf).\" In Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-14. 2020.\n\n> Another great paper that looks at requirements engineering for fairness in production ML systems in practice. It looks at challenges and suggest a checklist. It argues that it's really all about the process integration and about taking a system level view (rather than focusing on model properties). Includes the actual checklist.\n\nBietti, Elettra. \"[From ethics washing to ethics bashing: a view on tech ethics from within moral philosophy](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3351095.3372860).\" In *Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency*, pp. 210-219. 2020.\n\n> Arguing that most ethics discussions around AI and tech are too narrow as a tool for a purpose without allowing broader investigation involving all stakeholders, thus leading to a frustration with corporate ethics initiatives (ethics washing, ethics bashing). The paper then outlines the real role that moral philosophy can plan, which to me reads a lot like requirements engineering at the societal level: Stepping back, viewing all perspectives, trying to balance all views. May not be immediately useful, but I found the discussion interesting.\n\nBinns, Reuben. \"[Fairness in machine learning: Lessons from political philosophy](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/binns18a/binns18a.pdf).\" In *Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency*, pp. 149-159.

Safety & Robustness\n\n*There is a significant amount of machine learning research on safety and security, especially on narrow properties of robustness, but also some system-level discussions on safeguard mechanisms outside of the model. A software engineering professional should probably understand the tools and techniques. Many testing papers in the section Quality Assurance above cover robustness properties.*\n\nBorg, Markus, Cristofer Englund, Krzysztof Wnuk, Boris Duran, Christoffer Levandowski, Shenjian Gao, Yanwen Tan, Henrik Kaijser, Henrik L\u00f6nn, and Jonas T\u00f6rnqvist. \"[Safely entering the deep: A review of verification and validation for machine learning and a challenge elicitation in the automotive industry](https://www.atlantis-press.com/journals/jase/125905766).\" Journal of Automotive Software Engineering.

The search space by these pertubations and their combinations is typically very large and formal methods are used to produce conservative results (i.e., when it reports robustness against these pertubations it actually guaranteed to always return the same prediction, but there can be false positives). This is one of the more readable papers in this area that I have seen, but I'm not aware of any paper that really discusses how to use these robustness guarantees in production (typical scenarios seem to be to test robustness for a training set, for a set of important test cases, or to test it at runtime to make sure that a specific result is not just caused by a pertubation) and whether the considered pertubations are relevant or interesing for practical cases.\n\n\nCohen, Jeremy M., Elan Rosenfeld, and J.

They distinguish intrinsic trust which requires that a user\u2019s prior believe align with how the model reasons (here explanations and capability tests are useful) and extrinsic trust from a positive track record in production or a rigorous evaluation as the two key directions to increase trust. They specifically talk about how adhering to partial contracts may be sufficient to establish trust, but remain somewhat vague on the concept beyond some vague references to subpopulations and capabilities.\n\n## 14. Computational Notebooks\n\n*There is quite a bit of work on computational notebooks recently, mostly \nfocused on the exploratory work that data scientists perform. Some of this\nis focused on poor software engineering practices, e.g., with regard to\ntesting, modularity, reuse, versioning, dependency management, and determinism. \nMany papers in this area study pain points and suggest new tooling extensions.*\n\nPimentel, Joao Felipe, Leonardo Murta, Vanessa Braganholo, and Juliana Freire. \"[A large-scale study about quality and reproducibility of Jupyter notebooks](http://www2.ic.uff.br/~leomurta/papers/pimentel2019a.pdf).\" In 2019 IEEE/ACM 16th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), pp. 507-517.

Machine Learning Libraries and APIs\n\n*Software engineers like to study library adoption and challenges in using libraries and APIs.

They characterize the kinds of problems developers and users tend to have, some some solutions. Many issues seem to be common framework issues, such as documentation issues and breaking APIs. Some challenges, such as probabilistic correctness and missing debuggers, seem more ML specific.\n\nDilhara, Malinda, Ameya Ketkar, and Danny Dig. \"[Understanding Software-2.0: a study of machine learning library usage and evolution](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3453478).\" *ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)* 30, no. 4 (2021): 1-42.\n\n> Analysis of how machine learning libraries are used in popular Python code on GitHub, complementary to past studies of library use in notebooks (see Computational Notebooks section above). Focuses on how libraries are updated, finding many of the same challenges as with other library evolution and breaking changes in non-ML libraries.

It's kind of depressing how many different notions and problems there are and how few solutions. Even though they don't discuss requirements engineering in the paper, I put it here because it shows the complicated mess that fairness makes when trying to identify the right fairness requirements for an ML-enabled system. A requirements engineer must work with stakeholders to identify suitable requirements and make a lot of decisions, which won't be easy but will be necessary. This paper will probably give the requirements engineer the right vocabulary to talk to ML experts who need to assure the requirement and will provide enough pointers to identify what issues to probe for when talking to stakeholders.\n\nHolstein, Kenneth, Jennifer Wortman Vaughan, Hal Daum\u00e9 III, Miro Dudik, and Hanna Wallach. \"[Improving fairness in machine learning systems: What do industry practitioners need?](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/docs/daume19fairness.pdf)\" In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-16. 2019.\n\n> An interview study with engineers that consider fairness in their ML-enabled products. This one looks at the system/software-engineering level, beyond narrow fairness properties at the model level and discusses problems and strategies broadly, including fairness considerations across all lifecycle stages, possible checklists, best practices, holistic auditing, possibly even resulting in changes in system design. It does not mention requirements, but many issues are deeply rooted in requirements engineering and system design work.\n\nMadaio, Michael A., Luke Stark, Jennifer Wortman Vaughan, and Hanna Wallach. \"[Co-Designing Checklists to Understand Organizational Challenges and Opportunities around Fairness in AI](http://www.jennwv.com/papers/checklists.pdf).\" In Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-14. 2020.\n\n> Another great paper that looks at requirements engineering for fairness in production ML systems in practice. It looks at challenges and suggest a checklist. It argues that it's really all about the process integration and about taking a system level view (rather than focusing on model properties).

Safety & Robustness\n\n*There is a significant amount of machine learning research on safety and security, especially on narrow properties of robustness, but also some system-level discussions on safeguard mechanisms outside of the model. A software engineering professional should probably understand the tools and techniques. Many testing papers in the section Quality Assurance above cover robustness properties.*\n\nBorg, Markus, Cristofer Englund, Krzysztof Wnuk, Boris Duran, Christoffer Levandowski, Shenjian Gao, Yanwen Tan, Henrik Kaijser, Henrik L\u00f6nn, and Jonas T\u00f6rnqvist. \"[Safely entering the deep: A review of verification and validation for machine learning and a challenge elicitation in the automotive industry](https://www.atlantis-press.com/journals/jase/125905766).\" Journal of Automotive Software Engineering.

This is one of the more readable papers in this area that I have seen, but I'm not aware of any paper that really discusses how to use these robustness guarantees in production (typical scenarios seem to be to test robustness for a training set, for a set of important test cases, or to test it at runtime to make sure that a specific result is not just caused by a pertubation) and whether the considered pertubations are relevant or interesing for practical cases.\n\n\nCohen, Jeremy M., Elan Rosenfeld, and J.

See the [Human-AI Interaction](http://www.humanaiclass.org/) class at CMU for more pointers.*\n\nYang, Qian. \"[The role of design in creating machine-learning-enhanced user experience](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS17/paper/viewPaper/15363).\" In *2017 AAAI Spring Symposium Series*. 2017.\n\n> Excellent position paper arguing that currently most AI-enabled systems are driven by data availability rather than a vision for a product, leading to poor user experiences. Argues for the importance of designing the user interaction before or with developing the model, which needs AI literacy from UI designers and interdisciplinary collaboration. Has several good pointers to literature for going deeper.\n\nKocielnik, Rafal, Saleema Amershi, and Paul N. Bennett. \"[Will you accept an imperfect AI? Exploring designs for adjusting end-user expectations of AI systems](http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI2019/1proc/paper411.pdf).\" In *Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*, pp. 1-14. 2019.\n\n> Cool mturk-style study to explore different means of setting expectations for users that the ML predictions of the system might be occasionally wrong. This is useful to think at the system level about mitigations for incorrect predictions, here focusing on how to present them to users.

Very explicit about design goals and decisions; lots of pointers to related work on mental models and debugging for end users.\n\nJacovi, Alon, Ana Marasovi\u0107, Tim Miller, and Yoav Goldberg. \"[Formalizing trust in artificial intelligence: Prerequisites, causes and goals of human trust in AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07487).\" Proc. FAccT (2021).\n\n> Interesting conceptual discussion trying to define trust and trustworthiness, including an important recognition that risk is necessary for trust. They distinguish intrinsic trust which requires that a user\u2019s prior believe align with how the model reasons (here explanations and capability tests are useful) and extrinsic trust from a positive track record in production or a rigorous evaluation as the two key directions to increase trust. They specifically talk about how adhering to partial contracts may be sufficient to establish trust, but remain somewhat vague on the concept beyond some vague references to subpopulations and capabilities.\n\n## 14. Computational Notebooks\n\n*There is quite a bit of work on computational notebooks recently, mostly \nfocused on the exploratory work that data scientists perform. Some of this\nis focused on poor software engineering practices, e.g., with regard to\ntesting, modularity, reuse, versioning, dependency management, and determinism. \nMany papers in this area study pain points and suggest new tooling extensions.*\n\nPimentel, Joao Felipe, Leonardo Murta, Vanessa Braganholo, and Juliana Freire. \"[A large-scale study about quality and reproducibility of Jupyter notebooks](http://www2.ic.uff.br/~leomurta/papers/pimentel2019a.pdf).\" In 2019 IEEE/ACM 16th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), pp. 507-517.

Lots of statistics on usage and trends, sometimes a bit shallow but at a massive scale: for example, that most notebooks use only few libraries, that there are huge numbers of notebook authors, and that static analysis seems feasible.\n\n\nKery, Mary Beth, Marissa Radensky, Mahima Arya, Bonnie E. John, and Brad A. Myers. \"[The story in the notebook: Exploratory data science using a literate programming tool](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3173574.3173748).\" In Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-11. 2018.\n\n> Interview study with Jupyter users to understand their practices and challenges, highlighting especially the exploratory nature and the challenges with regard to cleaning up work and versioning. Subsequent work by the same authors suggested versioning tooling.\n\nChattopadhyay, Souti, Ishita Prasad, Austin Z.

Not only covering notebooks, but similar results to the more recent studies: Tracking rationale in exploratory programming is a key challenge, no abstraction, little reuse, negative results get lost; data scientists have different profiles from developers but often work with them; data scientists rarely collaborate with other data scientists.\n\nHead, Andrew, Fred Hohman, Titus Barik, Steven M.

Machine Learning Libraries and APIs\n\n*Software engineers like to study library adoption and challenges in using libraries and APIs. There are several papers that look specifically at APIs related to machine learning. Potentially useful when trying to understand the technical environment provided for data scientists.*\n\nZhang, Yuhao, Yifan Chen, Shing-Chi Cheung, Yingfei Xiong, and Lu Zhang. \"[An empirical study on TensorFlow program bugs](https://doi.org/10.1145/3213846.3213866).\" In Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis, pp. 129-140. 2018.\n\nZhang, Tianyi, Cuiyun Gao, Lei Ma, Michael R. Lyu, and Miryung Kim. \"[An empirical study of common challenges in developing deep learning applications](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~miryung/Publications/isese2019-deeplearningchallenge.pdf).\" In The 30th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE). 2019.\n\n> These two papers are examples of papers that analyzes public bug reports from issue trackers or question-answer sites (stackoverflow) for machine-learning frameworks. They characterize the kinds of problems developers and users tend to have, some some solutions. Many issues seem to be common framework issues, such as documentation issues and breaking APIs. Some challenges, such as probabilistic correctness and missing debuggers, seem more ML specific.\n\nDilhara, Malinda, Ameya Ketkar, and Danny Dig. \"[Understanding Software-2.0: a study of machine learning library usage and evolution](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3453478).\" *ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)* 30, no. 4 (2021): 1-42.\n\n> Analysis of how machine learning libraries are used in popular Python code on GitHub, complementary to past studies of library use in notebooks (see Computational Notebooks section above). Focuses on how libraries are updated, finding many of the same challenges as with other library evolution and breaking changes in non-ML libraries. Interesting brief survey with answers from 28 project maintainers that introduced machine learning late in the project, indicating applications that use ML for a new feature or to replace some prior code.\n\nIslam, Md Johirul, Hoan Anh Nguyen, Rangeet Pan, and Hridesh Rajan. \"[What do developers ask about ML libraries? A large-scale study using stack overflow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11940).\" *arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11940* (2019).\n\n> Large scale of stackoverflow questions related to 10 machine learning frameworks. Largely quantitative reporting, for example, which stages are most covered in those questions.\n\nChen, Zhenpeng, Yanbin Cao, Yuanqiang Liu, Haoyu Wang, Tao Xie, and Xuanzhe Liu. \"[Understanding Challenges in Deploying Deep Learning Based Software: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00760).\" Proc. FSE (2020).\n\n> Another StackOverflow study, this time focused on questions that developers ask regarding deploying deep learning models. Mostly API/documentation style questions close to the model rather than broader system deployment or MLOps questions and fairly shallow insights, but still potentially useful to see what developers struggle with current infrastructure at the API level. \n\n## 16. Misc\n\n*Various recommended and useful resources that do not fit well into the other categories.*\n\nHopkins, Aspen, and Serena Booth. \"[Machine Learning Practices Outside Big Tech: How Resource Constraints Challenge Responsible Development](http://www.slbooth.com/papers/AIES-2021_Hopkins_and_Booth.pdf).\" In Proceedings of the 2021 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AIES \u201921) (2021).\n\n> Very interesting interview studies with 17 participants from organizations building ML products outside of Big Tech companies, showing a wide range of challenges. The initial focus is on model fairness, but it shows how resource constraints influence many design decisions and tradeoffs and create many pain points in teams. Focused mostly on model development, not the larger system.\n\nMart\u00ednez-Fern\u00e1ndez, Silverio, Justus Bogner, Xavier Franch, Marc Oriol, Julien Siebert, Adam Trendowicz, Anna Maria Vollmer, and Stefan Wagner. \"[Software Engineering for AI-Based Systems: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01984).\" *arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01984* (2021).\n\n> Incredibly ambitious and broad survey, covering all of software engineering for systems with AI components (not just model building and deployment). The scope is so wide that it won\u2019t cover all papers in this area, often just selecting a few papers for a field with lots of research and tools (and they exclude grey literature), but it provides a very good overview and puts a lot of effort in organizing the literature.\n\nAmeisen, Emmanuel. \"Building Machine Learning Powered Applications: Going From Idea to Product.\" O'Reilly Media, 2020.\n\n> Nice book that takes a wider view of building ML applications than most, starting with discussing product goals (not just ML model goals) and going up to deployment and monitoring. It mostly stays fairly close to the model with more detailed content on the ML pipeline (including guidance for quality assurance and debugging), whereas the coverage of requirements engineering and deployment is more high-level and shallow. Overall a nice book with a healthy engineering attitude and a view that exceeds beyond the ML model.\n\nZinkevich, Martin. 2017 \u201c[Rules of Machine Learning: Best Practices for ML Engineering](http://martin.zinkevich.org/rules_of_ml/rules_of_ml.pdf).\u201d\n\n> Blog post.

Safety & Robustness\n\n*There is a significant amount of machine learning research on safety and security, especially on narrow properties of robustness, but also some system-level discussions on safeguard mechanisms outside of the model.

Many testing papers in the section Quality Assurance above cover robustness properties.*\n\nBorg, Markus, Cristofer Englund, Krzysztof Wnuk, Boris Duran, Christoffer Levandowski, Shenjian Gao, Yanwen Tan, Henrik Kaijser, Henrik L\u00f6nn, and Jonas T\u00f6rnqvist. \"[Safely entering the deep: A review of verification and validation for machine learning and a challenge elicitation in the automotive industry](https://www.atlantis-press.com/journals/jase/125905766).\" Journal of Automotive Software Engineering.

The search space by these pertubations and their combinations is typically very large and formal methods are used to produce conservative results (i.e., when it reports robustness against these pertubations it actually guaranteed to always return the same prediction, but there can be false positives). This is one of the more readable papers in this area that I have seen, but I'm not aware of any paper that really discusses how to use these robustness guarantees in production (typical scenarios seem to be to test robustness for a training set, for a set of important test cases, or to test it at runtime to make sure that a specific result is not just caused by a pertubation) and whether the considered pertubations are relevant or interesing for practical cases.\n\n\nCohen, Jeremy M., Elan Rosenfeld, and J.

Human-AI Interaction\n\n*This area is interesting and has seen significant attention recently, but goes beyond my typical software engineering considerations. See the [Human-AI Interaction](http://www.humanaiclass.org/) class at CMU for more pointers.*\n\nYang, Qian. \"[The role of design in creating machine-learning-enhanced user experience](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS17/paper/viewPaper/15363).\" In *2017 AAAI Spring Symposium Series*. 2017.\n\n> Excellent position paper arguing that currently most AI-enabled systems are driven by data availability rather than a vision for a product, leading to poor user experiences. Argues for the importance of designing the user interaction before or with developing the model, which needs AI literacy from UI designers and interdisciplinary collaboration. Has several good pointers to literature for going deeper.\n\nKocielnik, Rafal, Saleema Amershi, and Paul N. Bennett. \"[Will you accept an imperfect AI?

They distinguish intrinsic trust which requires that a user\u2019s prior believe align with how the model reasons (here explanations and capability tests are useful) and extrinsic trust from a positive track record in production or a rigorous evaluation as the two key directions to increase trust. They specifically talk about how adhering to partial contracts may be sufficient to establish trust, but remain somewhat vague on the concept beyond some vague references to subpopulations and capabilities.\n\n## 14. Computational Notebooks\n\n*There is quite a bit of work on computational notebooks recently, mostly \nfocused on the exploratory work that data scientists perform.

They characterize the kinds of problems developers and users tend to have, some some solutions. Many issues seem to be common framework issues, such as documentation issues and breaking APIs. Some challenges, such as probabilistic correctness and missing debuggers, seem more ML specific.\n\nDilhara, Malinda, Ameya Ketkar, and Danny Dig. \"[Understanding Software-2.0: a study of machine learning library usage and evolution](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3453478).\" *ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)* 30, no. 4 (2021): 1-42.\n\n> Analysis of how machine learning libraries are used in popular Python code on GitHub, complementary to past studies of library use in notebooks (see Computational Notebooks section above). Focuses on how libraries are updated, finding many of the same challenges as with other library evolution and breaking changes in non-ML libraries.

Slicing Test Data\n\n*Several papers focus on the idea of looking at subsets of test data evaluate the model on different subpopulations, rather than just looking at a single average accuracy result.*\n\nBarash, Guy, Eitan Farchi, Ilan Jayaraman, Orna Raz, Rachel Tzoref-Brill, and Marcel Zalmanovici. \"[Bridging the gap between ML solutions and their business requirements using feature interactions](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3338906.3340442).\" In Proceedings of the 2019 27th ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering, pp. 1048-1058. 2019.\n\n> Discusses how to slice validation data into subsets to observe how the model is doing on different subpopulations.

Unit Testing / Testing Capabilities\n\n*A number of different papers discuss (more or less explicitly) how to test specific capabilities or partial specifications of a model \u2013 which relates closely to traditional unit testing. Capabilities are usually concepts that a model shall learn that mirror domain knowledge or human strategies toward the problem, but that only capture a specific part of the solution. The approaches usually curate or generate test datasets specifically for these capabilities \u2013 i.e., unit tests consisting of multiple data points. Assuring capabilities is associated (more or less explicitly) with selecting more robust models that better generalize beyond the training distribution. Several capabilities also relate to invariants described below.*\n\nKaestner, Christian. \"[Rediscovering Unit Testing: Testing Capabilities of ML Models](https://towardsdatascience.com/rediscovering-unit-testing-testing-capabilities-of-ml-models-b008c778ca81).\" Medium Blog Post. 2021.\n\n> Shameless plug of my blogpost discussing this area and several papers in it more systematically, including how to identify capabilities and how to curate tests.\n\nRibeiro, Marco Tulio, Tongshuang Wu, Carlos Guestrin, and Sameer Singh. \"[Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with CheckList](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~wtshuang/static/papers/2020-acl-checklist.pdf).\" In Proceedings ACL, p. 4902\u20134912. (2020).\n\n> Paper suggests ways of generating test cases for capabilities of NLP models: First step is to list specific capabilities of a model (e.g., to handle negation or typos in sentences); for each capability then test cases are curated. Test cases are created by writing simple template-based generators (think: QuickCheck) of sentences with holes, where tool support is given for identifying values for those holes (synonyms etc). The model is then tested on those generated sentences, either by giving an expected value (e.g., all sentences generated from a template are positive) or by using invariants (metamorphic relations), see below. The paper shows many examples of tests and invariants; the evaluation shows that this approach of testing is useful for production teams to test whether the models actually learn basic capabilities.\n\nNaik, Aakanksha, Abhilasha Ravichander, Norman Sadeh, Carolyn Rose, and Graham Neubig. \"[Stress test evaluation for natural language inference](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1198.pdf).\" Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, p. 2340--2353 (2018).\n\n> Similar to the CheckList paper, this paper identifies 6 capabilities for NLP models, after performing an error analysis of common wrong predictions (think: root cause analysis). Capability tests are separated as competency tests, distraction tests, and noise tests, each encoding tests for specific capabilities, such as understanding antonyms or ignoring spelling errors. Test data is generated following handwritten patterns. The term \u201cstress test\u201d is explicitly introduced, but I consider it very misleading from a software testing perspective.\n\nMcCoy, R.

They similarly instruct crowd-workers to minimally modify sentences to change the outcome of inference tasks. By manually analyzing the kind of changes their participants make, they find 15 common patterns, which could be interpreted as capabilities they want the model to understand, such as sarcasm, distinguishing facts from hopes, and negation.

Model Invariants\n\nSegura, Sergio, Gordon Fraser, Ana B.

The key idea is that in the absence of a specification about what the model should do (which is the whole point of using ML), we might still be able to give partial specifications in terms of invariants about how outputs should relate for input pairs. For example, robustness conditions might be expressed by indicating that similar inputs should produce the same output or that linearly scaling all features or adding irrelevant features should not affect the outcome for certain classifiers. This is an interesting direction that enables testing of a number of invariants for ML models. The paper gives many pointers to other work in this area.\n\n\nRibeiro, Marco Tulio, Sameer Singh, and Carlos Guestrin. \"[Semantically equivalent adversarial rules for debugging NLP models](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1079.pdf).\" In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 856-865. 2018.\n\n> Example of testing for invariants in NLP models (in line with metamorphic testing, even though they do not refer to that concept). Here one expects certain linguistic invariants, for example, replacing \"isn't\" by \"is not\" should not change the outcome. These invariants are used to derive and prioritize tests and to then improve the model with more input data.\n\nSingh, Gagandeep, Timon Gehr, Markus P\u00fcschel, and Martin Vechev. \"[An abstract domain for certifying neural networks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3290354).\" Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages 3, no. POPL (2019): 1-30.\n\n> This is an example of a large group of paper that proofs specific invariants about models. For example, the specification could be that a model is robust to certain changes to its inputs (e.g., changing the brightness of pixels by +/- 20%) on the training set or certain classes of inputs. In contrast to much testing work, here results are verified over all input changes covered by a specification.\n\nGalhotra, Sainyam, Yuriy Brun, and Alexandra Meliou. \"[Fairness testing: testing software for discrimination](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3106237.3106277).\" In Proceedings of the 2017 11th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering, pp. 498-510. 2017.\n\n> Another application of testing invariants: here, for fairness certain outputs should be independent of changes to sensitive attributes. To simple for practical use in my book; limited to \"fairness through blindness\" (or \"unawareness\" or \"anti-classification\") and group fairness (but seemingly without addressing correlations in the data, since samples are generated uniformly).\n\n\nDing, J., D.

Note that these invariants are probabilistic in nature rather than hard tests. This can be used for testing and runtime monitoring (e.g., runtime adaptation and safety mechanisms) without the need for labels! Unfortunately, the paper is very vague about concrete interfaces and technical details and focuses primarily on ML details for additional active learning and weak supervision use cases.\n\nSalay, Rick, and Krzysztof Czarnecki. \"Improving ML safety with partial specifications.\" In *International Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability, and Security*, pp. 288-300. Springer, Cham, 2019.\n\n> Good discussion of why providing specifications for ML models is infeasible, followed by a somewhat abstract but well argued discussion of how partial specifications may be used in many different ways regardless. The discussion, while fairly abstract, covers several different facts, including suggesting that some specifications may be feasible on learned intermediate representations, that probabilistic constraints may be provided for data, that partial specifications may be provided for how to safely process model outputs, or that partial  specifications may be encoded during training.\n\n\n### 2.5.

The key contribution is an efficient search among subpopulations inspired by decision tree learning algorithms. Explicitly adopts testing and debugging terminology and goes beyond the simple invariants (anti-classification) in many other fairness testing papers, i.e., it can account for unfairness through correlated attributes.\n\n## 3. Debugging and Explainability Tools\n\n*How do we understand what a model does and why it is wrong? Debugging seems closely related with the quest for interpretability, even if just through approximations. This can focus on the model as well as on the data or the learning algorithm. (Some interpretability/explanability papers are listed in the [Transparency](#12-transparency-accountability-and-policy) section below, because they focus on how end user rather than developers understand explanations.)*\n\nMolnar, Christoph. \"[Interpretable machine learning.

Explanations can be shown to the user (though the book is fairly shallow on the challenges of doing this and larger system design questions), but they also seem very useful in understanding model (mis-)behavior, understanding individual wrong predictions and outliers. The book covers both techniques for understanding the model and understanding characteristics of the training data.

Fairness\n\n*Much of the interesting fairness discussions are really about requirements engineering in my book. Once a fairness measure and protected attributes are defined, measurement is typically not very challenging. The challenge is in identifying what notion of fairness is appropriate, a typical requirements engineering problem (and process challenge) negotiating the demands of various stakeholders. Here are a couple of papers that I liked.*\n\nCorbett-Davies, Sam, and Sharad Goel. \"[The measure and mismeasure of fairness: A critical review of fair machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00023).\" arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00023 (2018).\n\n> A comprehensive an critical discussion of different fairness measures often discussed in the ML community. It's kind of depressing how many different notions and problems there are and how few solutions. Even though they don't discuss requirements engineering in the paper, I put it here because it shows the complicated mess that fairness makes when trying to identify the right fairness requirements for an ML-enabled system. A requirements engineer must work with stakeholders to identify suitable requirements and make a lot of decisions, which won't be easy but will be necessary. This paper will probably give the requirements engineer the right vocabulary to talk to ML experts who need to assure the requirement and will provide enough pointers to identify what issues to probe for when talking to stakeholders.\n\nHolstein, Kenneth, Jennifer Wortman Vaughan, Hal Daum\u00e9 III, Miro Dudik, and Hanna Wallach. \"[Improving fairness in machine learning systems: What do industry practitioners need?](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/docs/daume19fairness.pdf)\" In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-16. 2019.\n\n> An interview study with engineers that consider fairness in their ML-enabled products. This one looks at the system/software-engineering level, beyond narrow fairness properties at the model level and discusses problems and strategies broadly, including fairness considerations across all lifecycle stages, possible checklists, best practices, holistic auditing, possibly even resulting in changes in system design.

Safety & Robustness\n\n*There is a significant amount of machine learning research on safety and security, especially on narrow properties of robustness, but also some system-level discussions on safeguard mechanisms outside of the model. A software engineering professional should probably understand the tools and techniques. Many testing papers in the section Quality Assurance above cover robustness properties.*\n\nBorg, Markus, Cristofer Englund, Krzysztof Wnuk, Boris Duran, Christoffer Levandowski, Shenjian Gao, Yanwen Tan, Henrik Kaijser, Henrik L\u00f6nn, and Jonas T\u00f6rnqvist. \"[Safely entering the deep: A review of verification and validation for machine learning and a challenge elicitation in the automotive industry](https://www.atlantis-press.com/journals/jase/125905766).\" Journal of Automotive Software Engineering.

This is one of the more readable papers in this area that I have seen, but I'm not aware of any paper that really discusses how to use these robustness guarantees in production (typical scenarios seem to be to test robustness for a training set, for a set of important test cases, or to test it at runtime to make sure that a specific result is not just caused by a pertubation) and whether the considered pertubations are relevant or interesing for practical cases.\n\n\nCohen, Jeremy M., Elan Rosenfeld, and J.

Interdisciplinary Teams\n\n*Building software systems with machine learning components requires expertise in several domains, almost always by bringing together people with different backgrounds in interdisciplinary teams.

See the [Human-AI Interaction](http://www.humanaiclass.org/) class at CMU for more pointers.*\n\nYang, Qian. \"[The role of design in creating machine-learning-enhanced user experience](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS17/paper/viewPaper/15363).\" In *2017 AAAI Spring Symposium Series*. 2017.\n\n> Excellent position paper arguing that currently most AI-enabled systems are driven by data availability rather than a vision for a product, leading to poor user experiences. Argues for the importance of designing the user interaction before or with developing the model, which needs AI literacy from UI designers and interdisciplinary collaboration. Has several good pointers to literature for going deeper.\n\nKocielnik, Rafal, Saleema Amershi, and Paul N. Bennett. \"[Will you accept an imperfect AI? Exploring designs for adjusting end-user expectations of AI systems](http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI2019/1proc/paper411.pdf).\" In *Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*, pp. 1-14. 2019.\n\n> Cool mturk-style study to explore different means of setting expectations for users that the ML predictions of the system might be occasionally wrong. This is useful to think at the system level about mitigations for incorrect predictions, here focusing on how to present them to users.

Very explicit about design goals and decisions; lots of pointers to related work on mental models and debugging for end users.\n\nJacovi, Alon, Ana Marasovi\u0107, Tim Miller, and Yoav Goldberg. \"[Formalizing trust in artificial intelligence: Prerequisites, causes and goals of human trust in AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07487).\" Proc. FAccT (2021).\n\n> Interesting conceptual discussion trying to define trust and trustworthiness, including an important recognition that risk is necessary for trust. They distinguish intrinsic trust which requires that a user\u2019s prior believe align with how the model reasons (here explanations and capability tests are useful) and extrinsic trust from a positive track record in production or a rigorous evaluation as the two key directions to increase trust. They specifically talk about how adhering to partial contracts may be sufficient to establish trust, but remain somewhat vague on the concept beyond some vague references to subpopulations and capabilities.\n\n## 14. Computational Notebooks\n\n*There is quite a bit of work on computational notebooks recently, mostly \nfocused on the exploratory work that data scientists perform. Some of this\nis focused on poor software engineering practices, e.g., with regard to\ntesting, modularity, reuse, versioning, dependency management, and determinism. \nMany papers in this area study pain points and suggest new tooling extensions.*\n\nPimentel, Joao Felipe, Leonardo Murta, Vanessa Braganholo, and Juliana Freire. \"[A large-scale study about quality and reproducibility of Jupyter notebooks](http://www2.ic.uff.br/~leomurta/papers/pimentel2019a.pdf).\" In 2019 IEEE/ACM 16th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), pp. 507-517.

Lots of statistics on usage and trends, sometimes a bit shallow but at a massive scale: for example, that most notebooks use only few libraries, that there are huge numbers of notebook authors, and that static analysis seems feasible.\n\n\nKery, Mary Beth, Marissa Radensky, Mahima Arya, Bonnie E. John, and Brad A. Myers. \"[The story in the notebook: Exploratory data science using a literate programming tool](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3173574.3173748).\" In Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-11. 2018.\n\n> Interview study with Jupyter users to understand their practices and challenges, highlighting especially the exploratory nature and the challenges with regard to cleaning up work and versioning. Subsequent work by the same authors suggested versioning tooling.\n\nChattopadhyay, Souti, Ishita Prasad, Austin Z.

Not only covering notebooks, but similar results to the more recent studies: Tracking rationale in exploratory programming is a key challenge, no abstraction, little reuse, negative results get lost; data scientists have different profiles from developers but often work with them; data scientists rarely collaborate with other data scientists.\n\nHead, Andrew, Fred Hohman, Titus Barik, Steven M.

Machine Learning Libraries and APIs\n\n*Software engineers like to study library adoption and challenges in using libraries and APIs. There are several papers that look specifically at APIs related to machine learning. Potentially useful when trying to understand the technical environment provided for data scientists.*\n\nZhang, Yuhao, Yifan Chen, Shing-Chi Cheung, Yingfei Xiong, and Lu Zhang. \"[An empirical study on TensorFlow program bugs](https://doi.org/10.1145/3213846.3213866).\" In Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis, pp. 129-140. 2018.\n\nZhang, Tianyi, Cuiyun Gao, Lei Ma, Michael R. Lyu, and Miryung Kim. \"[An empirical study of common challenges in developing deep learning applications](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~miryung/Publications/isese2019-deeplearningchallenge.pdf).\" In The 30th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE). 2019.\n\n> These two papers are examples of papers that analyzes public bug reports from issue trackers or question-answer sites (stackoverflow) for machine-learning frameworks. They characterize the kinds of problems developers and users tend to have, some some solutions. Many issues seem to be common framework issues, such as documentation issues and breaking APIs. Some challenges, such as probabilistic correctness and missing debuggers, seem more ML specific.\n\nDilhara, Malinda, Ameya Ketkar, and Danny Dig. \"[Understanding Software-2.0: a study of machine learning library usage and evolution](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3453478).\" *ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)* 30, no. 4 (2021): 1-42.\n\n> Analysis of how machine learning libraries are used in popular Python code on GitHub, complementary to past studies of library use in notebooks (see Computational Notebooks section above). Focuses on how libraries are updated, finding many of the same challenges as with other library evolution and breaking changes in non-ML libraries. Interesting brief survey with answers from 28 project maintainers that introduced machine learning late in the project, indicating applications that use ML for a new feature or to replace some prior code.\n\nIslam, Md Johirul, Hoan Anh Nguyen, Rangeet Pan, and Hridesh Rajan. \"[What do developers ask about ML libraries? A large-scale study using stack overflow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11940).\" *arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11940* (2019).\n\n> Large scale of stackoverflow questions related to 10 machine learning frameworks. Largely quantitative reporting, for example, which stages are most covered in those questions.\n\nChen, Zhenpeng, Yanbin Cao, Yuanqiang Liu, Haoyu Wang, Tao Xie, and Xuanzhe Liu. \"[Understanding Challenges in Deploying Deep Learning Based Software: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00760).\" Proc. FSE (2020).\n\n> Another StackOverflow study, this time focused on questions that developers ask regarding deploying deep learning models. Mostly API/documentation style questions close to the model rather than broader system deployment or MLOps questions and fairly shallow insights, but still potentially useful to see what developers struggle with current infrastructure at the API level. \n\n## 16. Misc\n\n*Various recommended and useful resources that do not fit well into the other categories.*\n\nHopkins, Aspen, and Serena Booth. \"[Machine Learning Practices Outside Big Tech: How Resource Constraints Challenge Responsible Development](http://www.slbooth.com/papers/AIES-2021_Hopkins_and_Booth.pdf).\" In Proceedings of the 2021 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AIES \u201921) (2021).\n\n> Very interesting interview studies with 17 participants from organizations building ML products outside of Big Tech companies, showing a wide range of challenges. The initial focus is on model fairness, but it shows how resource constraints influence many design decisions and tradeoffs and create many pain points in teams. Focused mostly on model development, not the larger system.\n\nMart\u00ednez-Fern\u00e1ndez, Silverio, Justus Bogner, Xavier Franch, Marc Oriol, Julien Siebert, Adam Trendowicz, Anna Maria Vollmer, and Stefan Wagner. \"[Software Engineering for AI-Based Systems: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01984).\" *arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01984* (2021).\n\n> Incredibly ambitious and broad survey, covering all of software engineering for systems with AI components (not just model building and deployment). The scope is so wide that it won\u2019t cover all papers in this area, often just selecting a few papers for a field with lots of research and tools (and they exclude grey literature), but it provides a very good overview and puts a lot of effort in organizing the literature.\n\nAmeisen, Emmanuel. \"Building Machine Learning Powered Applications: Going From Idea to Product.\" O'Reilly Media, 2020.\n\n> Nice book that takes a wider view of building ML applications than most, starting with discussing product goals (not just ML model goals) and going up to deployment and monitoring. It mostly stays fairly close to the model with more detailed content on the ML pipeline (including guidance for quality assurance and debugging), whereas the coverage of requirements engineering and deployment is more high-level and shallow. Overall a nice book with a healthy engineering attitude and a view that exceeds beyond the ML model.\n\nZinkevich, Martin. 2017 \u201c[Rules of Machine Learning: Best Practices for ML Engineering](http://martin.zinkevich.org/rules_of_ml/rules_of_ml.pdf).\u201d\n\n> Blog post.

Safety & Robustness\n\n*There is a significant amount of machine learning research on safety and security, especially on narrow properties of robustness, but also some system-level discussions on safeguard mechanisms outside of the model. A software engineering professional should probably understand the tools and techniques. Many testing papers in the section Quality Assurance above cover robustness properties.*\n\nBorg, Markus, Cristofer Englund, Krzysztof Wnuk, Boris Duran, Christoffer Levandowski, Shenjian Gao, Yanwen Tan, Henrik Kaijser, Henrik L\u00f6nn, and Jonas T\u00f6rnqvist. \"[Safely entering the deep: A review of verification and validation for machine learning and a challenge elicitation in the automotive industry](https://www.atlantis-press.com/journals/jase/125905766).\" Journal of Automotive Software Engineering.

This is one of the more readable papers in this area that I have seen, but I'm not aware of any paper that really discusses how to use these robustness guarantees in production (typical scenarios seem to be to test robustness for a training set, for a set of important test cases, or to test it at runtime to make sure that a specific result is not just caused by a pertubation) and whether the considered pertubations are relevant or interesing for practical cases.\n\n\nCohen, Jeremy M., Elan Rosenfeld, and J.

The paper highlights that team structures differ substantially, but that certain problems associated with certain decisions such as whether to develop the model first and then build a system around it or whether to start with the system.\n\nBusquim, Gabriel, Hugo Villamizar, Maria Julia Lima, and Marcos Kalinowski. \"[On the Interaction Between Software Engineers and Data Scientists When Building Machine Learning-Enabled Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05334).\" In *International Conference on Software Quality*, pp. 55-75.

They distinguish intrinsic trust which requires that a user\u2019s prior believe align with how the model reasons (here explanations and capability tests are useful) and extrinsic trust from a positive track record in production or a rigorous evaluation as the two key directions to increase trust.

Computational Notebooks\n\n*There is quite a bit of work on computational notebooks recently, mostly \nfocused on the exploratory work that data scientists perform.

They characterize the kinds of problems developers and users tend to have, some some solutions. Many issues seem to be common framework issues, such as documentation issues and breaking APIs. Some challenges, such as probabilistic correctness and missing debuggers, seem more ML specific.\n\nDilhara, Malinda, Ameya Ketkar, and Danny Dig. \"[Understanding Software-2.0: a study of machine learning library usage and evolution](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3453478).\" *ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)* 30, no. 4 (2021): 1-42.\n\n> Analysis of how machine learning libraries are used in popular Python code on GitHub, complementary to past studies of library use in notebooks (see Computational Notebooks section above).

Human-AI Interaction\n\n*This area is interesting and has seen significant attention recently, but goes beyond my typical software engineering considerations. See the [Human-AI Interaction](http://www.humanaiclass.org/) class at CMU for more pointers.*\n\nYang, Qian. \"[The role of design in creating machine-learning-enhanced user experience](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS17/paper/viewPaper/15363).\" In *2017 AAAI Spring Symposium Series*. 2017.\n\n> Excellent position paper arguing that currently most AI-enabled systems are driven by data availability rather than a vision for a product, leading to poor user experiences. Argues for the importance of designing the user interaction before or with developing the model, which needs AI literacy from UI designers and interdisciplinary collaboration. Has several good pointers to literature for going deeper.\n\nKocielnik, Rafal, Saleema Amershi, and Paul N. Bennett. \"[Will you accept an imperfect AI?

They distinguish intrinsic trust which requires that a user\u2019s prior believe align with how the model reasons (here explanations and capability tests are useful) and extrinsic trust from a positive track record in production or a rigorous evaluation as the two key directions to increase trust.

Computational Notebooks\n\n*There is quite a bit of work on computational notebooks recently, mostly \nfocused on the exploratory work that data scientists perform.

They characterize the kinds of problems developers and users tend to have, some some solutions. Many issues seem to be common framework issues, such as documentation issues and breaking APIs. Some challenges, such as probabilistic correctness and missing debuggers, seem more ML specific.\n\nDilhara, Malinda, Ameya Ketkar, and Danny Dig. \"[Understanding Software-2.0: a study of machine learning library usage and evolution](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3453478).\" *ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)* 30, no. 4 (2021): 1-42.\n\n> Analysis of how machine learning libraries are used in popular Python code on GitHub, complementary to past studies of library use in notebooks (see Computational Notebooks section above).

If sampled frequently enough, as discussed in the paper, also probabilistic bounds can be provided, although at significant computational costs (they use 100K model inferences per input).\n\nShneiderman, Ben. \"Bridging the gap between ethics and practice: Guidelines for reliable, safe, and trustworthy Human-Centered AI systems.\" *ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS)* 10, no. 4 (2020): 1-31.\n\n> Essay-style paper on the many layers of considerations necessary for building safe software systems, with a nice framing of software engineering practices framed by culture and regulation (see Fig 1!).

Interdisciplinary Teams\n\n*Building software systems with machine learning components requires expertise in several domains, almost always by bringing together people with different backgrounds in interdisciplinary teams.

Lots of problems arise at the interface between the ML component and the rest of the system.

The paper highlights that team structures differ substantially, but that certain problems associated with certain decisions such as whether to develop the model first and then build a system around it or whether to start with the system.\n\nBusquim, Gabriel, Hugo Villamizar, Maria Julia Lima, and Marcos Kalinowski. \"[On the Interaction Between Software Engineers and Data Scientists When Building Machine Learning-Enabled Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05334).\" In *International Conference on Software Quality*, pp. 55-75.

They characterize the kinds of problems developers and users tend to have, some some solutions. Many issues seem to be common framework issues, such as documentation issues and breaking APIs. Some challenges, such as probabilistic correctness and missing debuggers, seem more ML specific.\n\nDilhara, Malinda, Ameya Ketkar, and Danny Dig. \"[Understanding Software-2.0: a study of machine learning library usage and evolution](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3453478).\" *ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)* 30, no. 4 (2021): 1-42.\n\n> Analysis of how machine learning libraries are used in popular Python code on GitHub, complementary to past studies of library use in notebooks (see Computational Notebooks section above).
