Thus, the first heuristic attempts to match the Test Cases with a Focal Method having a name that matches, after removing possible `Test` prefix/suffix. \n\n1. Unique Method Call: if the previous heuristic did not identify any focal method, we compute the intersection between:\n    1. the list of method invocations within the test case and \n    1. the list of method defined within the focal class. If the intersection results in a unique method, then we select the method as the focal method. \n\nThe rationale behind this approach is the following: since we have already matched the test class with the focal class (with very high confidence heuristics), if the test case invokes a single method within that focal class, it is very likely testing that single method.\n\n",

                "description": "First release of methods2test!\r\n\r\nUnit testing is an essential part of the software development process, which helps to identify issues with source code in early stages of development and prevent regressions. Machine learning has emerged as viable approach to help software developers generate automated unit tests. However, generating reliable unit testcases that are semantically correct and capable of catching software bugs or unintended behavior via machine learning requires large, metadata-rich, datasets. We present Methods2Test: a large, supervised dataset of test cases mapped to corresponding methods under test (i.e., focal methods). This dataset contains 780,944 pairs of JUnit tests and focal methods, extracted from a total of 91,385 Java open source projects hosted on GitHub with licenses permitting re-distribution. The main challenge behind the creation of theMethods2Testwas to establish a reliable mapping between a test case and the relevant focal method. To this aim, we designed a set of heuristics, based on developers\u2019 best practices in software testing, which identify the likely focal method for a given test case. To facilitate further analysis, we store a rich set of metadata foreach method-test pair in JSON-formatted files. Additionally, we extract textual corpus from the dataset at different context levels, which we provide both in raw and tokenized forms, in order to en-able researchers to train and evaluate machine learning models for Automated Test Generation.",

Existing approaches are usually guided by test coverage criteria and generate synthetic test cases that are often difficult to read or understand even for developers familiar with the code base.\n\nWe introduce `methods2test`: a supervised dataset consisting of Test Cases and their corresponding Focal Methods from a large set of Java software repositories. To extract `methods2test`, we first parsed the Java projects to obtain classes and methods with their associated metadata. Next we identified each Test Class and its corresponding Focal Class. Finally, for each Test Case within a Test Class, we mapped it to the related Focal Method and obtain a set of Mapped Test Cases.\n</code></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>provider</td>\n    <td>\n      <div itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\" itemprop=\"provider\">\n        <table>\n          <tr>\n            <th>property</th>\n            <th>value</th>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td>name</td>\n            <td><code itemprop=\"name\">Microsoft</code></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td>sameAs</td>\n            <td><code itemprop=\"sameAs\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft</code></td>\n          </tr>\n        </table>\n      </div>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>citation</td>\n    <td><code itemprop=\"citation\">https://identifiers.org/arxiv:2009.05617</code></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n\n",
