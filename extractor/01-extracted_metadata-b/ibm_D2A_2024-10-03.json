However, according to [a recent survey](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9108283), lacking good and real-world datasets has become a major barrier for this field. Many existing works created self-constructed datasets based on different criteria and may just release partial datasets. The following table summarizes the characteristics of a few popular datasets for software vulnerability detection tasks.\n\n![Dataset Comparison.](docs/assets/dataset_comparison.png)\n\nDue to the lack of oracle, there is no perfect dataset that is large enough and has 100% correct labels for AI-based vulnerability detection tasks. Datasets generated from manual reviews have better quality labels in general. However, limited by their nature, they are usually not large enough for model training. On the other hand, although the quality of the D2A dataset is bounded by the capacity of static analysis, D2A can produce large datasets with better labels comparing to the ones labeled solely by static analysis, and complement existing manually labelled datasets.\n",

If we analyze a large number of consecutive version pairs and aggregate the results, some issues found in a before-commit version never disappear in an after-commit version. We say they are not very likely to be real bugs because they were never fixed. Then, we de-duplicate the issues found in all versions and adjust their classifications according to the commit history.
