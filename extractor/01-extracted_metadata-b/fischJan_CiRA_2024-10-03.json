Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n\n    The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\nSection 6 \u2013 Term and Termination.\n\n    This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\n    Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n        automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n        upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n    For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n    Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\nSection 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n    The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n    Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 \u2013 Interpretation.\n\n    For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n    To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n    No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n    Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n",

However, causality extraction from natural language (NL) is still an open research challenge as existing approaches fail to extract causality with reasonable performance. We understand causality extraction from requirements as a two step problem: First, we need to detect if requirements have causal properties or not, and then we need to understand and extract their causal relations. We developed a tool-supported approach for causality detection (CiRA, standing for Causality in Requirements Artifacts). This constitutes a first step towards causality extraction from NL requirements. Feel free to re-use our code :) \n\nThis repository contains our code and annotated data sets used in our case study:\n* The main data is contained in the \"annotated data sets\" folder.\n  - The file \"overall.csv\" contains all labeled sentences with all features.\n  - The other files contain all eligible sentences with one specific feature. Note that all files for features (except \"causal\") contain only the causal sub sets of the original set, as we only labeled the more specific features of causality for causal sentences.\n* The code for our machine-learning and deep-learning approaches at automatic causality detection can be found as Jupyter notebook files in the root folder.\n* Results regarding RQ6 are reported in detailed tables in the folder \"results\".\nFor more details on the paper, see \"Automatic Detection of Causality in Requirement Artifacts: the CiRA Approach\" at https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10766\nFor more details on the project, visit our website containing also a live demo of the DL detection approach at http://www.cira.bth.se/\n",
