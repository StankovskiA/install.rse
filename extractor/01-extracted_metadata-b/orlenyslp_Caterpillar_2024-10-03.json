                "value": "Caterpillar is a Business Process Management System (BPMS) prototype that runs on top of Ethereum and that relies on the translation of process models into smart contracts. More specifically, Caterpillar accepts as input a process model specified in BPMN and generates a set of smart contracts that captures the underlying behavior. The smart contracts, written in Ethereum's Solidity language, can then be compiled and deployed to the public or any other private Ethereum network using standard tools. Moreover, Caterpillar exhibits a REST API that can be used to interact with running instances of the deployed process models. \nCaterpillar also provides a set of modelling tools and an execution panel (in releases v1.0, 2.0 and 2.1) which interact with the underlying execution engine via the aforementioned REST API. The latter can also be used by third party software to interact in a programmatic way via Caterpillar with the instances of business process running on the blockchain. \nCaterpillar\u2019s code distribution in this repository contains three different folders in v1.0 and two in v2.0, v2.1 and v3.0. The folder __caterpillar_core__ includes the implementation of the core components, __execution_panel__ consists of the code of a BPMN visualizer that serves to keep track of the execution state of process instances and to lets users check in process data. The __services_manager__ folder contains the implementation for an external service which is used only in v1.0 for demonstration purposes. In v2.1, the source code is in the folder labelled as \"prototype\". Besides, the folder \"Dynamic Binding Example\" contains the binding policy and BPMN model used as running example in https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02909. \nAdditionally, a demo paper about v1.0: can be accessed from: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1920/BPM_2017_paper_199.pdf. We are keping the source code of v1.0 as a reference, although we are not currently working on such an implementation. \n> We are currently developing the release labeled __caterpillar-full (REST API - backend)__, which puts together the code of the releases v2.0, v2.1 and v3.0 into a single system instead of handling them as separated versions. The most recent release also migrates the system to the latest versions of the libraries (see package.json file), removing compatibility issues in v2.0, v2.1 and v3.0 (e.g., with web3, solc, node.js, etc.), which use older versions. Besides, we also refactored the code to increase readability, modularity, and reusability of the system. IMPORTANT: The release __caterpillar-full (REST API - backend)__ exposes the functionalities of Caterpillar through a REST API, i.e., there is no visual interface like the frontend application implemented by the execution-panel in the releases v2.0 and v2.1. We are currently designing a developing a new execution-panel (frontend application) whose release is expected by the beginning of 2021. \n",

For that, it is necessary only to install Docker (https://www.docker.com/) on your computer, then open a terminal and run the comand:\n\n     docker run --rm -it -p 3200:3200 -p 3000:3000 -p 8090:8090 orlenyslp/caterpillar-demo:v1\n\nInitially, you will see in the terminal, the creation of two services that are necesary for running the running example provided in https://github.com/orlenyslp/Caterpillar/blob/master/caterpillar-core/demo_running_example.bpmn. When the terminal displays the message \"Listening on port 3000\", it means that the core is running and then open a web browser to interact with execution panel that will be running in the URL http://localhost:3200/.\n\nThe execution panel provides a simple interface to interact with the core. The following options are available:\n\n + Creating and uploading bpmn models by clicking the button with the corresponding name. From the modeler, when you press save, the request is sent to the core. The information about the creation, compilation, and deploy of the smart contracts will be displayed in the terminal where the Docker container is running. If the model was successfully compiled, then a link to display its information will appear on the dashboard with the format <model_identifier>:<model_name>.\n \n > After upload the running example, it is necessary to go to the documentation section for both service tasks and to replace the strings labeled as $Assess_Loan_Risk_Address and $Appraise Property_Address with the corresponding addresses where the services are running. These addresses were displayed in the terminal when the Docker container starts running.\n \n+ Searching and displaying all the process model created in the current running of the container. The search will retrieve every model whose name or identifier contains the input as a substring. Empty searches will generate all the models created until now.\n \n + Displaying the solidity code generated from the process model and create new instances. From the dashboard, click the link to display the information of the desired process model. Here, there are accessible the solidity code and the active instances. There are also provided two buttons that allow the creation and updating of running instances. The button labeled with \"Refresh instances\" will remove from the list all the addresses to processes instances whose execution was concluded.\n \n + Executing process instances. By clicking on the address of the desired instance, it will be displayed a viewer that allows the visualization of the active tasks (in dark green) that can be executed by clicking on them. The viewer also allows switching to each active instance of the process. Every time a new instance is selected, the button labeled with \"Go\" must be pressed to display the current status of the instance.\n \nAll the results of the queries performed by the execution panel to the caterpillar core through the REST API will appear also in the terminal where the docker container is running.  \n \n",
