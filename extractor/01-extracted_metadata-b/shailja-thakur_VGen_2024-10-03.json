For this, we fine-tune pre-trained LLMs on Verilog datasets collected from GitHub and Verilog textbooks.\nWe construct an evaluation framework comprising test-benches for functional analysis and a flow to test the syntax of Verilog code generated in response to problems of varying difficulty. \nOur findings show that across our problem scenarios, the fine-tuning results in LLMs more capable of producing syntactically correct code (25.9\\% overall).\nFurther, when analyzing functional correctness, a fine-tuned open-source CodeGen LLM can outperform the state-of-the-art commercial Codex LLM (6.5\\% overall). \n",
