Log parsing, which converts raw log messages into structured data,\nis the first step to enabling automated log analytics. Existing log parsers extract the common part as log templates\nusing statistical features. However, these log parsers often fail to identify the correct templates and parameters\nbecause: 1) they often overlook the semantic meaning of log messages, and 2) they require domain-specific knowledge for\ndifferent log datasets. To address the limitations of existing methods, in this paper, we propose LogPPT to capture the\npatterns of templates using prompt-based few-shot learning. LogPPT utilises a novel prompt tuning method to recognise\nkeywords and parameters based on a few labelled log data. In addition, an adaptive random sampling algorithm is designed\nto select a small yet diverse training set. We have conducted extensive experiments on 16 public log datasets. The\nexperimental results show that LogPPT is effective and efficient for log parsing.\n \n",
