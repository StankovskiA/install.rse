Therefore, we provide a `get_python_bugs.py` script that provides a frame implementation for extracting the code before and after the bug fix included in our datasets. The script automatically reads the datasets and clones the original repositories (thanks to [PyDriller](https://github.com/ishepard/pydriller)).
