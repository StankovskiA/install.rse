To get the data, the projects' GitHub repositories were cloned, commit information was collected from the git log using [PyDriller](https://github.com/ishepard/pydriller), refactorings were classified using [Refactoring Miner](https://github.com/tsantalis/RefactoringMiner), and issue information was obtained by extracting issues from the Jira issue tracker. After that, code quality was inspected using two tools: Technical Debt items were analyzed with [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/), and code smells [2] and anti-patterns [3] with [Ptidej](http://www.ptidej.net/). In addition, the fault-inducing and -fixing commits were identified by applying [our implementation](https://github.com/clowee/OpenSZZ) of the SZZ algorithm [4] for version 1, and [our fork of SZZUnleashed](https://github.com/clowee/SZZUnleashed) for version 2.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r \n",
