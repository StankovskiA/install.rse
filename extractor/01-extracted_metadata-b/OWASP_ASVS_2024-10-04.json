To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a\ncontract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your\nacceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You\nsuch rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from\nmaking the Licensed Material available under these terms and\nconditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a.

For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c.

For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  g.

Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  k.

You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.\n               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You\n               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to\n               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material\n               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n  b. ShareAlike.\n\n     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share\n     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n\n       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons\n          license with the same License Elements, this version or\n          later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\n\n       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the\n          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition\n          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and\n          context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n\n       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms\n          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological\n          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the\n          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,\n     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

It has many programs to work towards this goal. One of those programs is the ASVS.\n\n### What is the [ASVS](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)?\n\nThe OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Project provides a basis for testing web application technical security controls and also provides developers with a list of requirements for secure development.\n\nThe primary aim of the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Project is to normalize the range in the coverage and level of rigor available in the market when it comes to performing Web application security verification using a commercially-workable open standard.\n\n### What is the Current Status of ASVS development?\n\nThe ASVS project is planning to release a 5.0 version during 2024 which will be a significant modification, similar to the scale of changes which happened during 4.0.\n\nWe will try, on a best efforts basis, to address issues and push changes to the \"bleeding edge\" master branch within the 5.0 folder **without altering current numbering** and using tagging ([see below](CONTRIBUTING.md#use-tags-to-describe-the-change)) to make changes clearer. This is in order to make it easier to use this branch on an ongoing basis. \n\nWe will no longer be accepting changes to the 4.0 folder which is now fixed at the 4.0.3 release.\n\nPlease also focus attention on the requirements themselves and **not** on the surrounding text or on the introductory chapters (files 0x01-0x04). This is because the text might have become outdated where requirements have changed and also because our goal is to significantly cut down this text in version 5.0.\n\n## How can I help?\n\nReading through the most recent version of ASVS is a great place to start.\n\nAfter familiarizing yourself with the current version, the next area to focus on is the Issues section. \n\nThere are two key types right now:\n\n* [![GitHub issue custom search](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-search?query=repo%3Aowasp%2Fasvs%20is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22Community%20wanted%22&style=flat&label=Community%20Wanted&labelColor=%23BFD4F2&color=grey)](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Community+wanted%22) - These are issues where we would really benefit from more eyes on a particular issue.\n* [![GitHub issue custom search](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-search?query=repo%3Aowasp%2Fasvs%20is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22Community%20needed%22&style=flat&label=Community%20Needed&labelColor=%23fbca04&color=grey)](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Community+needed%22) - These are issues where the relevant items will not get progressed without community input.\n\n\nPlease log ideas, issues or questions here: https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/issues. It\u2019s helpful to share if you have any ideas or if you find any bugs. We may subsequently ask you to open a pull request, https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/pulls, based on the discussion in the issue. \n\n## Additional Details for Helping\n\n### Before you open a Pull Request\n\nPlease do not open a pull request without first opening an associated issue. Please do not open an issue until you have used the search functionality to ensure that the issue has not previously been discussed and that there are no currently open issues relating to it. For example, [this link](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+bcrypt) searches for issues (open and closed) related to bcrypt.\n\nIf you are comfortable that it has not been previously discussed, you can open an issue. Please try and include the ASVS text you are talking about in the issue to save having to jump back and forth and please carry out all discussion in the associated issue and not in a PR discussion.\n\n### How to make changes to the bleeding edge during this period\n\nNote that changes should always be made only in the raw .md files and not in the CSV, JSON, XLSX, PDF, DOCX files, etc.\n\nTo help those who are using the \"bleeding edge\" version for their tests and in order to be able to track changes made during this period, we have prepared a set of labels to be used when making changes to the \"bleeding edge\" version during this time. The current bleeding edge working directory can be found here <https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/tree/master/5.0/en>.\n\n\n### Standard for changes\n\n#### Keep all current numbers\n\n* New requirements must be placed at the end of the relevant section\n* Deleted requirements must keep \"placeholder\" to avoid some other requirements to be added/moved to that number, examples:\n\n```\n| **1.2.1** | [MOVED TO 1.14.7] | | | | |\n```\n\n```\n| **5.5.1** | [DELETED] | | | | |\n```\n\n#### Use tags to describe the change\n\nProject leads will check and validate labels for changes. Please ask for a recommendation regarding the proper label in the issue tracker if you have any questions.\n\nThese tags should all be relative to how the requirement appeared in the latest release (v4.0.3) and will be used in a mapping file between releases.\n\nThe following tags should be added to any modified requirement as appropriate.\n\n* `[ADDED]` - New requirement (should only be added at the end of a sub-section.).\n* `[MODIFIED]` - Requirement description has been modified.\n* `[GRAMMAR]` - Requirement description has been corrected from a language or grammar perspective, but the wording or meaning of the description is not modified.\n* `[MOVED TO x.y.z]` - Placeholder to keep number, requirement has been moved to another category.\n* `[MOVED FROM a.b.c]` - Requirement has been moved to a different sub-section but **not** modified. (should only be added at the end of a sub-section.).\n* `[MODIFIED, MOVED FROM a.b.c]` - Requirement description has been modified **and** requirement has been moved to a different sub-section.\n* `[MODIFIED, SPLIT TO x.y.z]` - Requirement description has been modified **and** part of the requirement is split into a new separate requirement.\n* `[ADDED, SPLIT FROM a.b.c]` - New requirement which was previously part of another requirement.\n* `[DELETED]` - Placeholder to keep number, requirement has been deleted.\n* `[DELETED, MERGED TO x.y.z]` - Placeholder to keep number, requirement has been merged into another requirement.\n* `[DELETED, DUPLICATE OF x.y.z]` - Placeholder to keep number, requirement has been deleted because of clear duplicate to referenced requirement (referenced requirement do not have changes because of that).\n* `[DELETED, NOT IN SCOPE]` - Placeholder to keep number, requirement has been decided to be out of ASVS scope.\n* `[DELETED, INCORRECT]` - Placeholder to keep number, requirement was invalid or provided inadvisable advice.\n* `[DELETED, NOT PRACTICAL]` - Placeholder to keep number, requirement was not practical (enough) to implement in reality.\n* `[DELETED, INSUFFICIENT IMPACT]` - Placeholder to keep number, requirement was valid and in scope but provided insufficient benefit to be worthwhile.\n* `[SPLIT TO x.y.z, i.j.f]` - Placeholder to keep number, requirement has been split into 2 or more requirements to other categories.\n* `[LEVEL L1 > L2]` - Requirement level has changed. Level change label may exist also for `[MODIFIED]`, `[MOVED FROM]` and `[SPLIT FROM]`\n\n`SPLIT TO`, `MOVED TO`, `MERGED TO` labels must have matching labels with `SPLIT FROM`, `MOVED FROM`, `MERGED FROM`.\n\nCWE and/or NIST mapping changes do not require labels.\n\nTags must be placed before verification description, example:\n\n```\n| **12.4.2** | [MODIFIED] Verify that files obtained from untrusted sources are scanned by antivirus scanners to prevent upload and serving of known malicious content. | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 | 509 |\n```\n\n### Translations\n\nWe are also actively looking for translations of the 4.n branch!\n\nIf you are interested in creating a translation, here are some pointers for how you can help us:\n\n* Please first of all search the repository to see if there is already a translation for your proposed language. We currently have completed or in-progress translations in the following languages (but please search anyway in case this list is superseded!):\n    * In-progress\n        * None\n    * v4.0.3\n        * Spanish\n        * Simplified Chinese\n        * Arabic\n        * Russian\n        * French\n        * German\n        * Portuguese\n        * Italian\n    * v4.0.2\n        * German\n        * Russian\n    * v4.0.1\n        * Persian\n        * Turkish\n        * Japanese\n* If the language you are interested in appears, it would be great if you could reach out to the translator to see if you can help them.\n* Often there is work to do in creating markdown files or updating the translation to keep it up to date with latest changes.\n* We would request that you base your translation on the 4.0/en folder in the master branch as this is now static at the 4.0.3 version.\n* In order to start a translation, please start by forking the ASVS repository.\n    * If you are updating an existing translation which has markdown (just French as of December 2021), you can make modifications to the files in the existing folder based on language code (just /fr as at December 2021).\n    * If you are starting a new markdown translation, take a copy of the /en folder and rename it to the 2 character language code which will be used for the translation.\n* When you have completed the translation, please open a Pull Request against the master ASVS branch and one of the leaders will look at integrating it.\n* The leader will also use the relevant scripts to create the documents from the raw markdown (or you can if you want to save us some trouble).\n* Finally, the leader will back port the translation into the branch containing the ASVS version which was targeted (at this point, presumably v4.0.3).\n\nThank you for your help!!\n",
