                "value": "If you have just set up a fresh Docker installation and are attempting to run the `./shipwright.sh` script, you may encounter `permission denied` errors. Many docker installations are configured so that the user who runs docker is in the `docker` group. To fix this, you can follow these steps ([or reference this link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-fix-docker-got-permission-denied-while-trying-to-connect-to-the-docker-daemon-socket)):\n\n1. Run `sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}`\n2. Close all terminals / logout \n3. Log back in \n\nThe above instructions assume you're on linux. Alternatively, you should be able to run `sudo ./shipwright.sh` if you don't want to add yourself to the `docker` group.\n\n",
