Therefore, the algorithm is considered a black-box and is executed from end to end.  \nEach functional test is intended to verify an end-user requirement on the xAI algorithm rather than a specific internal module. Thus, functional tests share the advantage of being able to test different algorithms, if they respect the same input and output format. On the other hand, failed tests do not inform about the location of the errors but rather attribute it to the entire algorithm.\n",
