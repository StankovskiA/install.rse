Given the somewhat complementary, yet disparate nature of existing taxonomies of Dark Patterns, we aimed to create a unified taxonomy that merges together similar categories and provides a larger landscape of patterns for mobile and web apps toward which we can design and evaluate our automated detection approach. Our unified taxonomy is primarily a fusing of the various categories and subcategories derived by Gray et al. [1], Mathur et al. [2] and Brignull et al. [3]. Our final unified taxonomy, illustrated in the following figure, spans 7 parent categories which organize a total of 27 classes that describe different Dark Patterns. \nWe aimed to prioritize the detection strategy of AidUI toward certain patterns that carry with them distinct visual and textual cues which both manifest on a single screen. Thus, we identified a final set of 10 target Dark Patterns, toward which we oriented AidUI\u2019S analysis. The targeted Dark Pattern categories are marked with a <img src=\"docs_images/check.png\" width=\"18\"> in the above figure. We provide descriptions and examples of each Dark Pattern in this [document](docs_images/DP_patterns_examples.xlsx). \n",

It is important to note that AidUI operates *purely on pixel data* from UI screenshots, making it extensible to different software domains. \nWe set up the directory structure of the project to closely follow the architecture of the tool presented above.

As such, these instructions will likely not work on Windows or mcOS.***  \n1. #### Clone AidUI\nClone this repository by using the ```git clone``` command. If git is not already installed, please follow the installation instructions provided [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). \n2. #### Install Anaconda\nTo install Anaconda, please follow the instructions at this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/). \n3. #### Setup the conda environments\nInstalled Anaconda comes with a default conda environment _\"base\"_. We can check the available environments using the following command:\n```bash\nconda info --envs\n```\nFor AidUI, two conda environments need to be setup: _**\"dl_dp_obj_det_env\"**_ and _**\"dp_uied3\"**_ \nWe provide the specification files to build identical conda environments as ours:\n- _**\"dl_dp_obj_det_env\"**_: [env_specification_files/dl_dp_obj_det_env.txt](env_specification_files/dl_dp_obj_det_env.txt)\n- _**\"dp_uied3\"**_: [env_specification_files/dp_uied3.txt](env_specification_files/dp_uied3.txt) \n",
