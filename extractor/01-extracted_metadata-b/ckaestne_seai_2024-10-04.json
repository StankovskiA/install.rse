This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n2.

If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n3. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n4. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n---\n\n*Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

Assume you can learn a model to make predictions, what does it take to turn the model into a product and actually deploy it, have confidence in its quality, and successfully operate and maintain it? \n\nThe course is designed to establish a working relationship between **software engineers** and **data scientists**: both contribute to building AI-enabled systems but have different expertise and focuses. To work together they need a mutual understanding of their roles, tasks, concerns, and goals and build a working relationship. This course is aimed at **software engineers** who want to build robust and responsible systems meeting the specific challenges of working with AI components and at **data scientists** who want to understand the requirements of the model for production use and want to facilitate getting a prototype model into production; it facilitates communication and collaboration between both roles. The course is a good fit for student looking at a career as an **ML engineer**. *The course focuses on all the steps needed to turn a model into a production system in a responsible and reliable manner.*\n\n![Course overview](overview.svg)\n\nIt covers topics such as:\n\n* **How to design for wrong predictions the model may make?** How to assure *safety* and *security* despite possible mistakes? How to design the *user interface* and the entire system to operate in the real world?\n* **How to reliably deploy and update models in production?** How can we *test* the entire machine learning pipeline? How can *MLOps* tools help to automate and scale the deployment process? How can we *experiment in production* (A/B testing, canary releases)? How do we detect *data quality* issues,  *concept drift*, and *feedback loops* in production?\n* **How do we scale production ML systems?** How do we design a system to process huge amounts of training data, telemetry data, and user requests? Should we use stream processing, batch processing, lambda architecture, or data lakes?\n* **How to we test and debug production ML systems?** How can we *evaluate* the quality of a model\u2019s predictions in production? How can we *test* the entire AI-enabled system, not just the model? What lessons can we learn from *software testing*, *automated test case generation*, *simulation*, and *continuous integration* for testing for production machine learning?\n* **Which qualities matter beyond a model\u2019s prediction accuracy?** How can we identify and measure important quality requirements, including *learning and inference latency, operating cost, scalability, explainablity, fairness, privacy, robustness*, and *safety*? Does the application need to be able to *operate offline* and how often do we need to update the models? How do we identify what\u2019s important in a AI-enabled product in a production setting for a business? How do we resolve *conflicts* and *tradeoffs*?\n* **How do we build effective interdisciplinary teams?** How can we bring data scientists, software engineers, UI designers, managers, domain experts, big data specialists, operators, legal council, and other roles together and develop a *shared understanding* and *team culture*?\n\n**Examples and case studies** of ML-driven products we discuss include automated audio transcription; distributed detection of missing children on webcams and instant translation in augmented reality; cancer detection, fall detection, COVID diagnosis, and other smart medical and health services; automated slide layout in Powerpoint; semi-automated college admissions; inventory management; smart playlists and movie recommendations; ad fraud detection; delivery robots and smart driving features; and many others.\n\nAn extended group project focuses on building, deploying, evaluating, and maintaining a robust and scalable *movie recommendation service* under somewhat realistic  \u201cproduction\u201d conditions.\n",

Covers also **responsible AI** (safety, security, fairness, explainability) and **MLOps**. The course is crosslisted both as **Machine Learning in Production** and **AI Engineering**. For earlier offerings see websites for\u00a0[Fall 2019](https://ckaestne.github.io/seai/F2019),\u00a0[Summer 2020](https://ckaestne.github.io/seai/S2020), [Fall 2020](https://ckaestne.github.io/seai/F2020/), [Spring 2021](https://ckaestne.github.io/seai/S2021/) and [Spring 2022](https://ckaestne.github.io/seai/S2022/). This Fall 2022 offering is designed for students with some data science experience (e.g., has taken a machine learning course, has used sklearn) and basic programming skills, but will not expect a software engineering background (i.e., experience with testing, requirements, architecture, process, or teams is not required). Going forward we expect to offer this course at least every spring semester and possibly some fall semesters (not summer semesters).</em> \nFor researchers, educators, or others interested in this topic, we share all course material, including slides and assignments, under a creative commons license on GitHub (https://github.com/ckaestne/seai/) and have also published an article describing the rationale and the initial design of this course: [Teaching Software Engineering for AI-Enabled Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06691). A [textbook](https://ckaestne.medium.com/machine-learning-in-production-book-overview-63be62393581) is emerging. Video recordings of the Summer 2020 offering are online on the [course page](https://ckaestne.github.io/seai/S2020/#course-content). We would be happy to see this course or a similar version taught at other universities. See also an [annotated bibliography](https://github.com/ckaestne/seaibib) on research in this field.\n \n",

                "value": "*Machine learning (some experience recommended):* We suggest that you have basic familiarity with the process of extracting features, building and evaluating models, and a basic understanding of how and when different kinds of learning techniques work. Familiarity with Python and Jupyter notebooks is helpful. Courses such as 10-301, 10-315, and 05-434 will prepare you well, but project experience or self-learning from books or online courses will likely be sufficient for our purposes. For example, we recommend the book [Hands-On Machine Learning](https://cmu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CMU_INST/6lpsnm/alma991019665684604436) to get practical experience in building and evaluating models prior to taking this course. We have set up a *[prerequisite knowledge check](https://forms.gle/JcS61Uao7wHSFQen8)* as a Google Form, where we ask 10 questions on machine learning, which help you assess your background. This is set up as an anonymous and ungraded quiz, where you can compare your knowledge against what we believe is useful for you to be successful in this course (click on *\u201cview score\u201d* after submitting your answer). After submitting your answers, the system will give specific pointers to readings and exercises that may help you fill gaps in background knowledge.  \n*Programming (basic proficiency required):* The course has a substantial programming component, especially in the first assignment and the team project, so basic programming skills will be needed. If you take the course without programming experience, you will significantly struggle. If you do not meet the following criteria, we expect you might struggle significantly and might need to catch up on your own: (1) basic fluency in a programming language like Python, (2) ability to install and use libraries in that language, (3) ability to ssh into a unix machine and perform basic command line operations. We do not prescribe a programming language, but most student teams decide to work primarily in Python. We will will provide some introductions and examples for essential tools like Git, Docker, Grafana, and Jenkins in recitations, but we expect that you will be able to pick up new tools and libraries on your own. For example, we expect that you will be able, on your own, to learn basic use of a library like [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) to write a web service. Throughout the semester, expect to read lots of documentation and tutorials to learn various libraries and tools on your own. \nWe strive for providing clear specifications and clear point breakdowns for all homework to set clear expectations and taking the guessing out of homework. We often give you choices to self-direct your learning, deciding what to work on and how to address a problem (e.g., we never prescribe a programming language and often give choices to answer a subset of possible questions). Clear specifications and point breakdowns allow you to intentionally decide to skip parts of assignments with clear upfront consequences. All parts will be graded pass/fail, no partial credit. For opportunities to redo work, see *resubmissions* below. For grading participation and quizzes see below. Some assignments have a small amount of bonus points.  \n**Participation:** Design and engineering content requires active engagement with the material and discussions of judgment decisions on specific scenarios and cases. We strongly believe in in-class discussions and in-class exercises and want all students to participate, e.g., answering or asking questions in class, sharing own experiences, presenting results, or participating in in-class votes and surveys. We will give many opportunities for participation in every lecture and recitation. We take notes on participation throughout the semester and grade participation. Note that we do not consider mere passive attendance as participation, but only active engagement. We will provide feedback at mid-semester so you can check in on how you\u2019re doing. Again, please talk to us if you need accommodations. \n**Textbook, reading assignments, and reading quizzes:** We will be using Goeff Hulten's \"*Building Intelligent Systems: A Guide to Machine Learning Engineering*\" (ISBN: 1484234316) throughout much of the course. The library provides an [electronic copy](https://cmu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CMU_INST/6lpsnm/alma991019649190004436). In addition, we will provide various additional readings, including blog posts and academic papers, throughout the semester. \n**Teamwork:** Teamwork is an essential part of this course. The course contains a multi-milestone group project to be done in teams of 3-5 students. Teams will be assigned by the instructor. We will help teams throughout the semester and cover some specific content on teamwork as part of the course. Peer rating will be performed for team assignments with regard to *team citizenship* (i.e., being active and cooperative members), following the procedure from [this article](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/teaching/barbara-oakley/JSCL-collaboration.pdf). Use [this site](https://ckaestne.github.io/seai/F2022/assignments/peergrading.html) to preview the expected adjustments for peer ratings. \nExceptions to this policy will be made at discretion of the instructor in important circumstances, almost always involving a family or medical emergency and an email from your advisor \u2014 you can ask your academic advisor or the Dean of Student Affairs requesting the exception on your behalf. Please communicate also with your team about potential timing issues. \n**Auditing:** We welcome students to audit the course as long as the room capacities allow it. Auditing students will have access to all course materials (which is online anyway) and can attend lectures. Unfortunately we won't be able to grade homework submissions of auditing students or assign them to teams in the group project. To have auditing be on your transcript, approach us with the necessary paperwork. To assign a passing auditing grade at the end of the semester, we expect the student to get at least a 90% participation grade (see above) and a 70% score on reading quizzes. \n**Time management:** This is a 12-unit course, and it is our intention to manage it so that you spend close to 12 hours a week on the course, on average. In general, 4 hours/week will be spent in class and 1-2 hours on readings and reading quizzes, and 6-7 hours on assignments. Notice that much homework is done in groups, so please account for the overhead and decreased time flexibility that comes with groupwork. Please give the course staff feedback if the time the course is taking for you differs significantly from our intention. \n**Academic honesty and collaboration:** The usual policies apply, especially the University Policy on Academic Integrity. Many parts of the work will be done in groups. We expect that group members collaborate with one another, but that groups work independently from other groups, not exchanging results with other groups. Within groups and pairs, we expect that you are honest about your contribution to the group's work. This implies not taking credit for others' work and not covering for team members that have not contributed to the team. Otherwise, our expectations regarding academic honestly and collaboration for group and pair work are the same as for individual work, substituting elevated to the level of \"group.\"\nThe rest of this academic honesty and collaboration content is taken from the policy used in 17-214, which we reuse almost directly (with minor modifications, and attribution).\n\"You may not copy any part of a solution to a problem that was written by another student, or was developed together with another student, or was copied from another unauthorized source such as the Internet. You may not look at another student's solution, even if you have completed your own, nor may you knowingly give your solution to another student or leave your solution where another student can see it.\nHere are some examples of behavior that are inappropriate: \n* Copying or retyping, or referring to, files or parts of files (such as source code, written text, or unit tests) from another person or source (whether in final or draft form, regardless of the permissions set on the associated files) while producing your own. This is true even if your version includes minor modifications such as style or variable name changes or minor logic modifications.\n* Getting help that you do not fully understand, and from someone whom you do not acknowledge on your solution.\n* Writing, using, or submitting a program that attempts to alter or erase grading information or otherwise compromise security of course resources.\n* Lying to course staff.\n* Giving copies of work to others, or allowing someone else to copy or refer to your code or written assignment to produce their own, either in draft or final form. This includes making your work publicly available in a way that other students (current or future) can access your solutions, even if others' access is accidental or incidental to your goals. Beware the privacy settings on your open source accounts!\n* Coaching others step-by-step without them understanding your help.\nIf any of your work contains any statement that was not written by you, you must put it in quotes and cite the source. If you are paraphrasing an idea you read elsewhere, you must acknowledge the source. Using existing material without proper citation is plagiarism, a form of cheating. If there is any question about whether the material is permitted, you must get permission in advance. We will be using automated systems to detect software plagiarism.\nIt is not considered cheating to clarify vague points in the assignments, lectures, lecture notes; to give help or receive help in using the computer systems, compilers, debuggers, profilers, or other facilities; or to discuss ideas at a very high level, without referring to or producing code.\nAny violation of this policy is cheating. The minimum penalty for cheating (including plagiarism) will be a zero grade for the whole assignment. Cheating incidents will also be reported through University channels, with possible additional disciplinary action (see the University Policy on Academic Integrity).\nIf you have any question about how this policy applies in a particular situation, ask the instructors or TAs for clarification.\" \n**Accommodations for students with disabilities:** If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, we encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with us as early in the semester as possible. We will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, we encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu. \n**Respect for diversity:** It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students\u2019 learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Especially in lectures on fairness we will also cover diversity discussions, typically through a lens of the contemporary discourse in the US. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.  \n**A note on self care.** Please take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.\nIf you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.\n \n",
