Finally, since the goal of collecting these features is for solving the Test Case Prioritization (TCP) problem, it runs various experiments to measure the scalability and effectiveness of TCP.\n\nIn the following sections, we provide information on the requirements and instructions for running this project as well as descriptions regarding the data that this project generates.

In other words, among all analyzed commits, there is no commit in which both entities have changed. On the other hand, the four real numbers represent `support`, `forward_confidence`, `backward_confidence`, and `lift`. Note that assuming A has a dependency on B, `forward_confidence` is the confidence for A given B (A|B) and `backward_confidence` is the confidence for B given A (B|A). For precise definitions of the mentioned association metrics, please refer to the paper. Additionally, the `tar.csv` file represents the dependencies between test entities and entities of the SUT.

It requires two main sources of data: source code and CI data. The source code can be either provided in form of a GitHub repository or a path to the source code. For CI data, a path should be provided which includes a repository folder containing two CSV files with a specific format (the file format will be discussed later). The arguments for this sub-command are shown in the following table.\n\nArgument Name | Description\n--- | ---\n-p PROJECT_PATH, --project-path PROJECT_PATH | Project's source code Git repository path.\n-s PROJECT_SLUG, --project-slug PROJECT_SLUG | The project's GitHub slug, e.g., apache/commons.\n-c CI_DATA_PATH, --ci-data-path CI_DATA_PATH | Path to CI data root directory.\n-o OUTPUT_PATH, --output-path OUTPUT_PATH | Specifies the directory to save resulting datasets.\n\nAn example of using the `dataset` sub-command:\n```\npython main.py dataset -s apache/commons -c ../rtp-torrent -o ./datasets/apache@commons\n```\n\n**Note:** At least one of the `--project-path` or `--project-slug` arguments should be provided since the project requires the source code for analysis.\n",

The `<repo-name>-full.csv` file should contain test case execution records for all jobs across all builds, which includes the following columns:\n- `travisBuildId`: Id of the Travis CI build.\n- `travisJobId`: Id of the Travis CI job.\n- `testName`: The class name of the test case including its package name (e.g., `com.example.Test`).\n- `duration`: The duration of the test case execution in seconds.\n- `count`: The number of test methods executed in the test class.\n- `failures`: The number of failures that occurred in the execution of the test class.\n- `errors`: The number of errors that occurred in the execution of the test class.\n- `skipped`: The number of skipped test methods in the execution of the test class.\n\n**Note:** The full test class name is required for matching it with its corresponding source file. Also, the last four columns are based on the data available in *Maven* logs. `failures` refer to test cases' failures due to wrong outputs or assertion errors, whereas `errors` refer to unexpected behaviors such as runtime exceptions.\n\nThe `<repo-name>-builds.csv` file should contain build information, which includes the following columns:\n- `tr_build_id`: Id of the Travis CI build.\n- `git_all_built_commits`: Full hashes of all Git commits that were built in the build, and the commit hashes are separated by the `#` character.\n- `gh_build_started_at`: The starting date and time of the build (e.g., `2020-01-15 17:56:24 UTC`).\n- `jobs`: A JSON list of all Travis CI job ids that were executed in the build (e.g., `\"[620564834, 620564835]\"`).\n",

Since it requires test case features as input, the `dataset` sub-command should be successfully executed before executing this sub-command. The arguments for this sub-command are shown in the following table.\n\nArgument Name | Description\n--- | ---\n-o OUTPUT_PATH, --output-path OUTPUT_PATH | Specifies the directory to load required data and save results.\n-t TEST_COUNT, --test-count TEST_COUNT | Specifies the number of recent builds to test the trained models on.\n-r {best,all}, --ranking-models {best,all} | Specifies the ranking model(s) to use for learning.\n-e EXPERIMENT, --experiment EXPERIMENT | Specifies the experiment to run. Only works when the best ranking model is selected.\n\nAn example of using the `learn` sub-command:\n```\npython main.py learn -o ./datasets/apache@commons -t 50 -r best -e FULL\n```\n\n**Note:** The `all` option for the `--ranking-models` argument runs the learning experiments on six ranking algorithms including all test case features. Based on our study, the Random Forest (RF) model was the best algorithm, and therefore, when the option `best` is selected for `--ranking-models`, RF will be used. Finally, the `--experiment` can have the following values: {FULL, WO_IMP, WO_TES_COM, WO_TES_PRO, WO_TES_CHN, WO_REC, WO_COV, WO_COD_COV_COM, WO_COD_COV_PRO, WO_COD_COV_CHN, WO_DET_COV, W_Code, W_Execution, W_Coverage}. In the `FULL` experiment, all test case features will be included in the learning process. However, the options that begin with `WO_` will exclude the feature group in their name (e.g., `WO_TES_COM` will exclude `TES_COM`), and the options that begin with `W_` will only include the high-level feature group in their name.
