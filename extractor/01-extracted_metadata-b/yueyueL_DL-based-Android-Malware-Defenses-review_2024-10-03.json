In this paper, we conducted a systematic literature review to search and analyze how deep learning approaches have been applied in the context of malware defenses in the Android environment. As a result, a total of 132 studies covering the period 2014-2021 were identified. Our investigation reveals that, while the majority of these sources mainly consider DL-based on Android malware detection, 53 primary studies (40.1 percent) design defense approaches based on other scenarios. This review also discusses research trends, research focuses, challenges, and future research directions in DL-based Android malware defenses. \n",
