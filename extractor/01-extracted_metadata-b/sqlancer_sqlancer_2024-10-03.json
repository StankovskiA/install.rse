It randomly selects a row, called a pivot row, for which a query is generated that is guaranteed to fetch the row. If the row is not contained in the result set, a bug has been detected. It is fully described [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04174). PQS is the most powerful technique, but also requires more implementation effort than the other two techniques. It is currently unmaintained. |\n| Non-optimizing Reference Engine Construction (NoREC) | NoREC aims to find optimization bugs. It is described [here](https://www.manuelrigger.at/preprints/NoREC.pdf). It translates a query that is potentially optimized by the DBMS to one for which hardly any optimizations are applicable, and compares the two result sets. A mismatch between the result sets indicates a bug in the DBMS.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Ternary Logic Partitioning (TLP)                     | TLP partitions a query into three partitioning queries, whose results are composed and compare to the original query's result set. A mismatch in the result sets indicates a bug in the DBMS. In contrast to NoREC and PQS, it can detect bugs in advanced features such as aggregate functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Cardinality Estimation Restriction Testing (CERT)    | CERT aims to find performance issues through unexpected estimated cardinalities, which represent the estimated number of returned rows. It is described [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00355). It derives a query to a more restrict query, whose estimated cardinality should be no more than that for the original query. An violation indicates a potential performance issue. CERT supports TiDB, CockroachDB, and MySQL. |\n| Differential Query Plans (DQP)                       | DQP aims to find logic bugs in database systems by checking whether the query plans of the same query perform consistently. It is described [here](https://bajinsheng.github.io/assets/pdf/dqp_sigmod24.pdf). DQP supports MySQL, MariaDB, and TiDB.|\n \n",

Given a database state, we mutate it after no new unique query plans have been observed by randomly-generated queries on the database state aiming to cover more unique query plans for exposing more logics of DBMSs.

                "value": "# Development\n\n## Working with Eclipse\n\nDeveloping SQLancer using Eclipse is expected to work well. You can import SQLancer with a single step:\n\n```\nFile -> Import -> Existing Maven Projects -> Select the SQLancer directory as root directory -> Finish\n```\nIf you do not find an option to import Maven projects, you might need to install the [M2Eclipse plugin](https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/).\n\n\n## Implementing Support for a New DBMS\n\nThe DuckDB implementation provides a good template for a new implementation. The `DuckDBProvider` class is the central class that manages the creation of the databases and executes the selected test oracles. Try to copy its structure for the new DBMS that you want to implement, and start by generate databases (without implementing a test oracle). As part of this, you will also need to implement the equivalent of `DuckDBSchema`, which represents the database schema of the generated database. After you can successfully generate databases, the next step is to generate one of the test oracles. For example, you might want to implement NoREC (see `DuckDBNoRECOracle` or `DuckDBQueryPartitioningWhereTester` for TLP). As part of this, you must also implement a random expression generator (see `DuckDBExpressionGenerator`) and a visitor to derive the textual representation of an expression (see `DuckDBToStringVisitor`).\n\nPlease consider the following suggestions when creating a  PR to contribute a new DBMS:\n* Ensure that `mvn verify -DskipTests=true` does not result in style violations.\n* Add a [CI test](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml) to ensure that future changes to SQLancer are unlikely to break the newly-supported DBMS. It is reasonable to do this in a follow-up PR\u2014please indicate whether you plan to do so in the PR description.\n* Add the DBMS' name to the [check_names.py](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/blob/master/src/check_names.py) script, which ensures adherence to a common prefix in the Java classes.\n* Add the DBMS' name to the [README.md](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/blob/master/README.md#supported-dbms) file.\n* It would be easier to review multiple smaller PRs, than one PR that contains the complete implementation. Consider contributing parts of your implementation as you work on their implementation.\n\n### Expected Errors\n\nMost statements have an [ExpectedError](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/blob/aa0c0eccba4eefa75bfd518f608c9222c692c11d/src/sqlancer/common/query/ExpectedErrors.java) object associated with them. This object essentially contains a list of errors, one of which the database system might return if it cannot successfully execute the statement. These errors are typically added through a trial-and-error process while considering various tradeoffs. For example, consider the [DuckDBInsertGenerator](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/blob/aa0c0eccba4eefa75bfd518f608c9222c692c11d/src/sqlancer/duckdb/gen/DuckDBInsertGenerator.java#L38) class, whose expected errors are specified in [DuckDBErrors](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/blob/aa0c0eccba4eefa75bfd518f608c9222c692c11d/src/sqlancer/duckdb/DuckDBErrors.java#L90). When implementing such a generator, the list of expected errors might first be empty. When running the generator for the first time, you might receive an error such as \"create unique index, table contains duplicate data\", indicating that creating the index failed due to duplicate data. In principle, this error could be avoided by first checking whether the column contains any duplicate values. However, checking this would be expensive and error-prone (e.g., consider string similarity, which might depend on collations); thus, the obvious choice would be to add this string to the list of expected errors, and run the generator again to check for any other expected errors. In other cases, errors might be best addressed through improvements in the generators. For example, it is typically straightforward to generate syntactically-valid statements, which is why syntax errors should not be ignored. This approach is effective in uncovering internal errors; rather than ignoring them as an expected error, report them, and see [Unfixed Bugs](#unfixed-bugs) below.\n\n### Bailing Out While Generating a Statement\n\nIn some cases, it might be undesirable or even impossible to generate a specific statement type. For example, consider that SQLancer tries to execute a `DROP TABLE` statement (e.g., see [TiDBDropTableGenerator](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/blob/30948f34acc2354d6be18a70bdeeebff1e73fa48/src/sqlancer/tidb/gen/TiDBDropTableGenerator.java)), but the database contains only a single table. Dropping the table would result in all subsequent attempts to insert data or query it to fail. Thus, in such a case, it might be more efficient to \"bail out\" by abandoning the current attempt to generate the statement. This can be achieved by throwing a `IgnoreMeException`. Unlike for other exceptions, SQLancer silently continues execution rather than reporting this exception to the user.\n\n\n### Typed vs. Untyped Expression Generation\n\nEach DBMS implementation provides an expression generator used, for example, to generate expressions used in `WHERE` clauses. We found that DBMS can be roughly classified into \"permissive\" ones, which apply implicit type conversions when needed and \"strict\" ones, which provide only few implicit conversions and output an error when the type is unexpected. For example, consider the following test case:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE t0(c0 TEXT);\nINSERT INTO t0 VALUES ('1');\nSELECT * FROM t0 WHERE c0;\n```\n\nIf the test case is executed using MySQL, which is a permissive DBMS, the `SELECT` fetches a single row, since the content of the `c0` value is interpreted as a boolean. If the test case is executed using PostgreSQL, which is a strict DBMS, the `SELECT` is not accepted as a valid query, and PostgreSQL outputs an error `\"argument of WHERE must be type boolean\"`.  The implementation of the expression generator depends on whether we are dealing with a permissive or a strict DBMS. Since SQLancer's main goal is to find logic bugs, we want to generate as many valid queries as possible.\n\nFor a permissive DBMS, implementing the expression generator is easier, since the expression generator does not need to care about the type of the expression, since the DBMS will apply any necessary conversions implicitly. For MySQL, the main `generateExpression` method thus does not accept any type as an argument (see [MySQLExpressionGenerator](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/blob/86647df8aa2dd8d167b5c3ce3297290f5b0b2bcd/src/sqlancer/mysql/gen/MySQLExpressionGenerator.java#L54)). This method can  be called when a expression is required for, for example, a `WHERE` clause. In principle, this approach can also be used for strict DBMS, by adding errors such as `argument of WHERE must be type boolean` to the list of expected errors. However, using such an \"untyped\" expression generator for a strict DBMS will result in many semantically invalid queries being generated.\n\nFor a strict DBMS, the better approach is typically to attempt to generate expressions of the expected type. For PostgreSQL, the expression generator thus expects an additional type argument (see [PostgreSQLExpressionGenerator](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/blob/86647df8aa2dd8d167b5c3ce3297290f5b0b2bcd/src/sqlancer/postgres/gen/PostgresExpressionGenerator.java#L251)). This type is propagated recursively. For example, if we require a predicate for the `WHERE` clause, we pass boolean as a type. The expression generator then calls a method `generateBooleanExpression` that attempts to produce a boolean expression, by, for example, generating a comparison (e.g., `<=`). For the comparison's operands, a random type is then selected and propagated. For example, if an integer type is selected, then `generateExpression` is called with this type once for the left operand, and once for the right operand. Note that this process does not guarantee that the expression will indeed have the expected type. It might happen, for example, that the expression generator attempts to produce an integer value, but that it produces a double value instead, namely when an integer overflow occurs, which, depending on the DBMS, implicitly converts the result to a floating-point value.\n\n### Unfixed Bugs\n\nOften, some bugs are fixed only after an extended period, meaning that SQLancer will repeatedly report the same bug. In such cases, it might be possible to avoid generating the problematic pattern, or adding an expected error with the internal error message. Rather than, for example, commenting out the code with the bug-inducing pattern, a pattern implemented by the [TiDBBugs class](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/blob/4c20a94b3ad2c037e1a66c0b637184f8c20faa7e/src/sqlancer/tidb/TiDBBugs.java) should be applied. The core idea is to use a public, static flag for each issue, which is set to true as long as the issue persists (e.g., see [bug35652](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/blob/4c20a94b3ad2c037e1a66c0b637184f8c20faa7e/src/sqlancer/tidb/TiDBBugs.java#L55)). The work-around code is then executed\u2014or the problematic pattern should not be generated\u2014if the flag is set to true (e.g., [an expected error is added for bug35652](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/blob/59564d818d991d54b32fa5a79c9f733799c090f2/src/sqlancer/tidb/TiDBErrors.java#L47)). This makes it easy to later on identify and remove all such work-around code once the issue has been fixed.\n\n## Options\n\nSQLancer uses [JCommander](https://jcommander.org/) for handling options. The `MainOptions` class contains options that are expected to be supported by all DBMS-testing implementations. Furthermore, each `*Provider` class provides a method to return an additional set of supported options.\n\nAn option can include lowercase alphanumeric characters, and hyphens. The format of the options is checked by a unit test.\n\n## Continuous Integration and Test Suite\n\nTo improve and maintain SQLancer's code quality, we use multiple tools:\n* The [Eclipse code formatter](https://code.revelc.net/formatter-maven-plugin/), to ensure a consistent formatting (Run `mvn formatter:format` to format all files).\n* [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/), to enforce a consistent coding standard.\n* [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/), which finds programming flaws using static analysis.\n* [SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/), which also uses static analysis to find bugs and programming flaws.\n\nYou can run them using the following command:\n\n```\nmvn verify\n```\n\nWe use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml) to automatically check PRs.\n\n\n## Testing\n\nAs part of the GitHub Actions check, we use smoke testing by running SQLancer on each supported DBMS for some minutes, to test that nothing is obviously broken. For DBMS for which all bugs have been fixed, we verify that SQLancer cannot find any further bugs (i.e., the return code is zero).\n\nIn addition, we use [unit tests](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/tree/master/test/sqlancer) to test SQLancer's core functionality, such as random string and number generation as well as option passing. When fixing a bug, add a unit test, if it is easily possible.\n\nYou can run the tests using the following command:\n\n```\nmvn test\n```\n\nNote that per default, the smoke testing is performed only for embedded DBMS (e.g., DuckDB and SQLite). To run smoke tests also for the other DBMS, you need to set environment variables. For example, you can run the MySQL smoke testing (and no other tests) using the following command:\n\n```\nMYSQL_AVAILABLE=true mvn -Dtest=TestMySQL test\n```\n\nFor up-to-date testing commands, check out the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file.\n\n## Reviewing\n\nReviewing is an effective way of improving code quality. Everyone is welcome to review any PRs. Currently, all PRs are reviewed at least by the main contributor, @mrigger. Contributions by @mrigger are currently not (necessarily) reviewed, which is not ideal. If you are willing to regularly and timely review PRs, indicate so in the SQLancer Slack workspace.\n\n## Naming Conventions\n\nEach class specific to a DBMS is prefixed by the DBMS name. For example, each class specific to SQLite is prefixed by `SQLite3`. The naming convention is [automatically checked](src/check_names.py).\n\n## Commit History\n\nPlease pay attention to good commit messages (in particular subject lines). As basic guidelines, we recommend a blog post on [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) written Chris Beams, which provides 7 useful rules. Implement at least the following of those rules:\n1. Capitalize the subject line. For example, write \"**R**efactor the handling of indexes\" rather than \"**r**efactor the handling of indexes\".\n2. Do not end the subject line with a period. For example, write \"Refactor the handling of indexes\" rather than \"Refactor the handling of indexes.\".\n3. Use the imperative mood in the subject line. For example, write \"Refactor the handling of indexes\" rather than \"Refactoring\" or \"Refactor**ed** the handling of indexes\".\n\nPlease also pay attention to a clean commit history. Rather than merging with the main branch, use `git rebase` to rebase your commits on the main branch. Sometimes, it might happen that you discover an issue only after having already created a commit, for example, when an issue is found by `mvn verify` in the CI checks. Do not introduce a separate commit for such issues. If the issue was introduced by the last commit, you can fix the issue, and use `git commit --amend` to change the latest commit. If the change was introduced by one of the previous commits, you can use `git rebase -i` to change the respective commit. If you already have a number of such commits, you can use `git squash` to \"collapse\" multiple commits into one.

The shortcut CTRL+C can be used to terminate SQLancer manually. If SQLancer does not find any bugs, it executes infinitely. The option `--num-tries` can be used to control after how many bugs SQLancer terminates. Alternatively, the option `--timeout-seconds` can be used to specify the maximum duration that SQLancer is allowed to run.\n\nIf you launch SQLancer without parameters, available options and commands are displayed. Note that general options that are supported by all DBMS-testing implementations (e.g., `--num-threads`) need to precede the name of DBMS to be tested (e.g., `sqlite3`). Options that are supported only for specific DBMS (e.g., `--test-rtree` for SQLite3), or options for which each testing implementation provides different values (e.g. `--oracle NoREC`) need to go after the DBMS name.\n",

SQLancer should print only an `AssertionError` and produce a corresponding log file, if it has identified a bug. To upgrade SQLancer to support a new DBMS version, either two options are advisable: (1) the generators can be updated to no longer generate certain patterns that might cause errors (e.g., which might be the case if a keyword or option is no longer supported) or (2) the newly-appearing errors can be added as [expected errors](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/blob/354d591cfcd37fa1de85ec77ec933d5d975e947a/src/sqlancer/common/query/ExpectedErrors.java) so that SQLancer ignores them when they appear (e.g., this is useful if some error-inducing patterns cannot easily be avoided).\n\nAnother reason for many failures on a supported version could be that error messages are printed in a non-English locale (which would then be visible in the stack trace). In such a case, try setting the DBMS' locale to English (e.g., see the [PostgreSQL homepage](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/locale.html)).\n",
