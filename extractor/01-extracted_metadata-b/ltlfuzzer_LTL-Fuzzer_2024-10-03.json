It is built on top of the [AFL](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) fuzzer and involves additional program instrumentation to check if a particular execution trace is accepted by the B\u00fcchi automaton representing the negation of the given LTL property. Our framework takes as input a sequential program written in C/C++, and an LTL property. It finds violations, or counterexample traces, of the LTL property in stateful software systems.  \nLTL-Fuzzer substantially extends directed greybox fuzzing to witness arbitrarily complex event orderings. We note that existing directed greybox fuzzing approaches are limited to witnessing reaching a location or witnessing simple event orderings such as crashes or use-after-free. This is the main contribution of our work: algorithms and an implementation\nof our ideas in a tool that is able to validate any LTL property, thereby covering a much more expressive class of properties than crashes or use-after-free. Our work adapts directed greybox fuzzing (which directs the search towards specific program locations) to find violations of temporal logic formulae.\n \n",
