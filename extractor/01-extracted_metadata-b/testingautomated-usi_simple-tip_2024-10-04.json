Specifically, this includes one `runner` module per case study (e.g. case_study_imdb.py), whose main method allows to run the experiments for said case study. It also contains the specific selection of hyperparameters used for each case study. In addition, the package contains several generic modules (which are used by the `runner` modules) to create and use the appraoches implemented in the `core` package (e.g. handler_surprise.py).\n- `./src/core/`\nContains the modules which we expect to be widely useful in 3rd party studies, much beyond the scope of our paper. It includes, e.g., the implementations of the tested approaches (surprise adequacies, neuron coverages, deep gini). It is designed to facilitate reusability: Special care was given to the code documentation, interfaces are defined using type-hints, and crutial hyperparameters are configurable. The core package is also largely tested by unit tests. Upon acceptance of our paper, the contents of this package will be publicly released as standalone pip-packages.\n- `./src/plotters/`\nContains the logic to create the final results (tables, plots, etc.) from the raw intermediate results persisted when running the experiments. For example, the logic to average the results over all 100 re-runs, or the logic to compute the heatmap of effect size and p-values (Fig. 3 in the paper) can be found in this package.\n- `./Dockerfile` and `./requirements.txt`\nSpecification of the software infrastructure we used to run the experiments. Building docker image specified in the docker file will create the same docker image as the one we used to run the experiments.\n- `./reproduction.py`\nA CLI which allows to easily re-run parts of our experiements (described above).\n \n",
