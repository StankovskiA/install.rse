                "value": "# Instructions to use CVEfixes\n\n\n## Converting the CVEfixes dataset from the compressed SQL dump\n\nBecause of limitations in GitHub storage, we provide a compressed SQL\ndump of the _CVEfixes_ vulnerability dataset via Zenodo with DOI:\n[10.5281/zenodo.4476563](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4476563). The\nfollowing script can be used to convert this compressed SQL dump into\nan SQLite3 database:\n\n```console\n$ sh Code/create_CVEfixes_from_dump.sh\n```\n\nIt is also possible to do this by hand (Windows users can use\n`sqlite3.exe` instead of `sqlite3`)\n\n```console\n$ gzcat Data/CVEfixes.sql.gz | sqlite3 Data/CVEfixes.db\n```\n\n## Exploring the vulnerability data\n\nThe overall structure of the database is as shown in [ER diagram](Doc/ER_diagram.png). \nYou can use any SQLite tool to view and query the\ndatabase. [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) is an\nopen source visual explorer for SQLite databases that is available for\nMac, Windows and Linux.\n\nWe provide a [Jupyter Notebook](Examples/query_CVEfixes.ipynb) with\nexample queries to extract the data at different abstraction levels,\ncode to generate statistics, as well as the code to replicate all\ntables and plots presented in the [paper](Doc/Bhandari-Naseer-Moonen_-_CVEfixes.pdf) \nbased on the _CVEfixes_ data. \n\nSome example queries to extract the part of _CVEfixes_ database are as\nfollows:\n\n- a query to extract all the method_level vulnerability data of C\n  programming language.\n\n```console\nSQL_QUERY = \"SELECT m.method_change_id, m.name, m.code, m.before_change, f.programming_language\nfrom file_change f, method_change m\nWHERE m.file_change_id=f.file_change_id\nAND f.programming_language='C';\"\n```\n\n- another example as a query to extract all the code patches of Java\n  programming language that have added/removed only a single statement\n  to fix vulnerabilities.\n\n```console\nSQL_QUERY = \"SELECT cv.cve_id, f.filename, f.num_lines_added, f.num_lines_deleted, f.code_before, f.code_after, cc.cwe_id\nFROM file_change f, commits c, fixes fx, cve cv, cwe_classification cc\nWHERE f.hash = c.hash\nAND c.hash = fx.hash\nAND fx.cve_id = cv.cve_id\nAND cv.cve_id = cc.cve_id\nAND f.num_lines_added<=1\nAND f.num_lines_deleted<=1\nAND f.programming_language='Java';;\"\n```\n\n\n\n# (Re)Collecting the CVEfixes dataset from scratch\n\n\n## Setting up the configuration file\n\nCreate a `.CVEfixes.ini` configuration file in the project root\n(where this INSTALL.md file lives) defines the following variables \nto customize paths in the `[CVEfixes]` section: \n\n* `database_path`: directory that should contain the CVEfixes \n  database file (and some temporary files during extraction). \n\n* `sample_limit`: The number of samples to be extracted, \n  sample_limit = 0 is interpreted as unlimited samples, \n  this is discussed in more detail below. \n\nThe repository contains a file `example.CVEfixes.ini`.\n\n\n## Setting up a GitHub token\n\nWe observe that more than 98% repositories of _CVEfixes_ are hosted on\nGitHub. The [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)\nallows us to retrieve meta information of public repositories. Without\nconfiguration of a token, this API is rate limited and only allows\ngathering the information for approximately 25 repositories. Thus, we\nrecommend the user to obtain a GitHub token and configure a [GitHub]\nsection of the `.CVEfixes.ini` configuration file which has two\nvariables `user` and `token` for your GitHub username and access token\nrespectively. Change the values of these variables to set up the token.\nIt is recommended to not disclose the token information to prevent its\nmisuse.\n\n\n## Gathering the CVEfixes dataset\n\nThe following script recreates the _CVEfixes_ database file from scratch\nup for a time-frame from 2002 up to the latest available CVE records. Be\nwarned that depending on available internet speed and processing power,\nthe process can take quite some time (with a modern laptop, around 8-10\nhours on T1, and up to 3 days on a simple home connection). Note that\nrunning this script will overwrite an existing `CVEfixes.db`  file in\n`database_path`, but that it is possible to restore the database from\nthe SQL dump on Zenodo, as mentioned above. Before running the\nextraction, see also the above remark on [setting up a GitHub\ntoken](#setting-up-a-github-token).\n\n\n```console\n$ sh Code/create_CVEfixes_from_scratch.sh\n```\n\n## Gathering only a sample of CVEfixes for demonstration purposes\n\nAs mentioned, the complete extraction of the _CVEfixes_ dataset could\ntake up to 3 days depending on the internet connection. To enable simple\ndemonstrations, the `.CVEfixes.ini` configuration file has a\n`sample_limit` variable that is used to define the number of commits for\nCVEs to collect. Setting `sample_limit = 0` is interpreted as unlimited,\ni.e. collect all available data. When the `sample_limit` is set to a\nvalue different than `0`, only that many commits are collected from CVEs\nfor the current year. We tested `sample_limit = 25`, which took\napproximately 12 minutes to gather. However, this can take much longer\nif any of the CVEs corresponds to major projects. Therefore, whenever\n`sample_limit` is set to a value different than `0`, we filter out five\nmajor projects to minimize the time to collect a sample. \n\n\n",

The dataset is organized as a relational database and covers \n12107 vulnerability fixing commits in 4249 open source projects for \na total of 11873 CVEs in 272 different Common Weakness Enumeration \n(CWE) types. The dataset includes the source code before and after \nchanging 51342 files and 138974 functions.
