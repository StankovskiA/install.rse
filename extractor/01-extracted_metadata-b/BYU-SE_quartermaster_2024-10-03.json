This stage isn't used anywhere and so there is no immediate demand to support it.\r\n\r\n**Non-breaking Changes**\r\n* Stages can now return arbitrary data, separate from the success / fail `responseType`\r\n* Bug fix: Circuit breaker could exist in some stuck states. Improved tests to ensure this doesn't happen\r\n* Improve documentation inside classes\r\n* Improve code readability (see `Event.ts`)\r\n* Add documentation for custom event properties\r\n* Update Jest framework",
