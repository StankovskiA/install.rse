In addition, we compared the DBRD techniques proposed in research with those used in Mozilla and VSCode. Surprisingly, we observe that a simple technique already adopted in practice can achieve comparable results as a recently proposed research tool. Our study gives reflections on the current state of DBRD, and we share our insights to benefit future DBRD research.},\n    doi = {10.1145/3576042},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1145/3576042},\n    issn = {1049-331X},\n    address = {New York, NY, USA},\n    publisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},\n    year = {2022},\n    title = {Duplicate Bug Report Detection: How Far Are We?},\n    author = {Zhang, Ting and Han, DongGyun and Vinayakarao, Venkatesh and Irsan, Ivana Clairine and Xu, Bowen and Thung, Ferdian and Lo, David and Jiang, Lingxiao},\n}",
