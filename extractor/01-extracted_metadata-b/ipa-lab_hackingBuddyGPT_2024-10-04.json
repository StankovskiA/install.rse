Meanwhile, @DianaStrauss  was improving the Web API testing agent.\r\n\r\nAlso see [our latest hacking benchmark results for multiple models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11409).\r\n\r\n## Notable user-visible changes:\r\n\r\n- [GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models) are now supported as LLM backend\r\n- the `hackingBuddyGPT` CLI is installed (alias to the `wintermute` CLI) to provide consistency\r\n- massively improved web api testing agent:\r\n    - new response analyzer to create a report from the testing findings\r\n    - prompt engineering: improved prompt creation, now categorized into task and state planning prompts\r\n    - Streamlined the OpenAPI documentation generation (reconnaissance) process\r\n- restructured introductory usecases and agents\r\n    - moved them into `src/hackingbuddygpt/usecases/examples`\r\n    - their names (used by the CLI) start with `Ex`\r\n- bump minimal python version to python 3.10\r\n\r\n## Notable developer-visible changes:\r\n\r\n- allow for streaming responses from LLMs\r\n- The class hierarchy has been refactored. `UseCases` showcase the different hacking behaviors provided hackingBuddyGPT. They offer developers flexibility how they implement their hacking techniques. To streamline development, we introduce the `Agent` base-class. Agents perform hacking in steps/rounds. Developers can automatically wrap an Agent within a usecases to integrate new agents with minimal development overhead into hackingBuddyGPT.

It then executes that command on the virtual machine, prints its output and starts a new round (in which it also includes the output of prior rounds) until it reaches step number 10 or becomes root:\n\n```bash\n# start wintermute, i.e., attack the configured virtual machine\n$ python src/hackingBuddyGPT/cli/wintermute.py LinuxPrivesc --llm.api_key=sk...ChangeMeToYourOpenAiApiKey --llm.model=gpt-4-turbo --llm.context_size=8192 --conn.host=192.168.122.151 --conn.username=lowpriv --conn.password=trustno1 --conn.hostname=test1\n\n\n# install dependencies for testing if you want to run the tests\n$ pip install '.[testing]'\n```\n",
