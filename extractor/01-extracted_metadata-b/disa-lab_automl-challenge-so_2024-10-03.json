In the traditional approach, a human expert analyses data and explores the search space to find the best model. AutoML aims to democratize machine learning to domain experts by automating and abstracting machine learning-related complexities. It aims to solve the challenge of automating the Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyper-parameter tuning (CASH) problem. AutoML is a combination of automation and ML. It automates various tasks on the ML pipeline such as data prepossessing, model selection, hyper-parameter tuning, and model parameter optimization. They employ various types of techniques such as grid search, genetics, and Bayesian algorithms. Some AutoML services also help with data visualization, model interpretability, and deployment. \nIn this study, we download a large number of Stack Overflow posts that contain discussions about various low-code platforms. We apply topic modeling on the textual contents of the posts. We label the topics and categorize the topics into hierarchies. We analyze the popularity and difficulty of the topics. Our study offers several findings based on the four research questions as discussed below;\n \n",
