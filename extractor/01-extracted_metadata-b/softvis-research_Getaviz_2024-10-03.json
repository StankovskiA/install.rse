Among other things it provides proper visualizations for identifying and refactoring antipatterns, locating runtime bottlenecks, assessing software quality, and tracking changes across multiple versions. To get a first impression, have a look at [our showcases](http://home.uni-leipzig.de/svis/Showcases/) that are available online. You can adapt the visualizations as well as the user interface according to your needs. Getaviz visualizes the structure and behavior of several programming languages (*Java*, *Ruby*, *PHP*, and *C#*) and can enrich these visualizations with evolutionary information from *git* and *svn* repositories. They can be explored via *browser*, *HTC Vive*, or *Oculus Rift*. We support many different visualizations, e.g., Recursive Disk ([2D](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/svis/getaviz/index.php?setup=web/RD%20freemind&model=RD%20freemind) and [3D](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/svis/getaviz/index.php?setup=web/RD%20reek&model=RD%203D%20reek)), [City](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/svis/getaviz/index.php?setup=web/City%20freemind&model=City%20original%20freemind), [City Floors](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/svis/getaviz/index.php?setup=web/City%20freemind&model=City%20floor%20freemind), [City Bricks](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/svis/getaviz/index.php?setup=web/City%20freemind&model=City%20bricks%20freemind), and many more.\n \n",
