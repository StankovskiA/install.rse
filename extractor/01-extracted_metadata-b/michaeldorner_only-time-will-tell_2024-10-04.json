We decide against Python's internal serialization module pickle due to its inherent security issues and lousy performance. Since JSON does not support sets, we use sorted arrays for the reachables. Writing an adjacency matrix as CSV is a magnitude slower than our approach.  \nAt the current state, we do not support multiple cores since the whole graph is kept in memory (about 100 GB peak memory footprint) which causes performance issues on Windows and macOS due to their restriction on [COW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write) and process forking. Please find more information [here](https://bugs.python.org/issue33725) and [here](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods).  \nWe used an explicit caching approach, i.e., we precomputed each needed relation as `dict` to improve the performance. The built-in caching via [`functools.cache`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.cache) is not intended to work properly with instance methods (such as `hypergraph.vertices()`). For custom-made solutions such as suggest [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68052994/1864294) I am not smart enough.\n \n",
