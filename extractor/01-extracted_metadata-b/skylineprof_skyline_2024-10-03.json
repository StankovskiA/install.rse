It needs to be used with v0.5.0+ of the Skyline plugin.\r\n\r\nAs of this release, Skyline has been promoted from alpha to beta. The Skyline project now lives under the @skylineprof organization. Skyline also now has a website, which you can visit at https://skylineprof.github.io.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n- Remote projects are now supported for advanced users. [Read more about remote projects on the Skyline website.](https://skylineprof.github.io/docs/remote)\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n- The providers have been simplified. Models returned by the `skyline_model_provider()` no longer need to produce a scalar tensor (i.e. Skyline no longer needs to call `.backward()` directly on the model's output).\r\n- When an error occurs during profiling, Skyline will now display the file context (file name and line number) associated with the error when possible.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Skyline has been updated to work with PyTorch 1.4.0 and 1.5.1",

The Skyline profiler has only been tested on Ubuntu 18.04, but should\nalso work on other versions of Ubuntu that have Python 3.6+. The Skyline plugin\nhas been tested on both Ubuntu 18.04 and macOS Mojave (10.14) with the latest\nversion of Atom.\n\n\n### Installation\n\nFor interactive profiling (i.e. Skyline inside Atom), you need both components.\nIf you only plan to use Skyline for [Standalone Profiling](standalone.md), you\nonly need the Skyline profiler component.\n\n#### Skyline Profiler\n\nThe Skyline profiler can be installed using `pip`. In your shell, run:\n\n```bash\npip install skyline-cli\n```\n\nAs with most Python packages, we recommend installing Skyline inside a\n`virtualenv`. After installing the Skyline profiler, you will be able to\ninvoke it by running `skyline` in your shell.\n\n#### Skyline Atom Plugin\n\nThe Skyline Atom plugin can be installed using `apm` (the Atom package\nmanager), which should be automatically installed after you install\n[Atom](https://atom.io). In your shell, run:\n\n```bash\napm install skyline\n```\n\nYou can alternatively install Skyline by using Atom's preferences pane and\nsearching for `skyline` under the Install section.\n\nAfter installing the Skyline plugin, the `Skyline:Toggle` command should be\navailable in your command palette. A Skyline sub-menu should also appear\nunder the \"Packages\" menu.\n",

However, depending on your\nuse case and development setup, you may only need the `pip` package or you may\nneed to install the packages on different machines. **See the [installation\npage on the website](https://skylineprof.github.io/docs/install) for detailed\ninstallation instructions tailored to different use cases.** \nAfter installing Skyline, you will be able to invoke the command line tool by\nrunning `skyline` in your shell. \nTo get started quickly, check out the [Getting Started page on the Skyline\nwebsite](https://skylineprof.github.io/docs/getting-started). \nFor more information about using Skyline, including standalone profiling and\nsetting up a remote project, please [see the Skyline\ndocumentation](https://skylineprof.github.io/docs/). \nSkyline uses semantic versioning. Before the 1.0.0 release, backward\ncompatibility between minor versions will not be guaranteed. \nThe Skyline command line tool and plugin use *independent* version numbers.\nHowever, it is very likely that minor and major versions of the command line\ntool and plugin will be released together (and hence share major/minor version\nnumbers). \nSkyline began as a research project at the [University of\nToronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu) in collaboration with [Tovi\nGrossman](https://www.tovigrossman.com) and [Gennady\nPekhimenko](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~pekhimenko/).\n \n",
