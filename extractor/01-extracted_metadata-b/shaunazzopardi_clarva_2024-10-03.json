The tool attempts to find parts of the program that can be ignored soundly for verification, and to remove transitions in a DATE that are not needed to identify a violation at runtime. [Soot](https://github.com/Sable/soot), a Java bytecode analyser, is used to support this analysis. \n**Input**: \n1. *mode* of the analysis --\n    (a) *fast*: uses a Class Hierarchy Analysis (CHA) to create a more or less sound callgraph, while ignoring java.*, jdk.*, and sun.* packages, giving a quick (should take seconds) analysis; and\n    (b) *intensive* uses [SPARK](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-36579-6_12.pdf), creating a more precise callgraph and pointer-analysis by considering also library files, leading to a longer processing time (should take some minutes);\n2. *filePath to* DATE property --- an automata specifying the violating traces of the previous program (through AspectJ notions) with transitions over events (method calls) and conditions encoding data state (see [Larva Manual](http://www.cs.um.edu.mt/svrg/Tools/LARVA/LARVA-manual.pdf) for the syntax of DATEs).\n3. *root directory of* compiled Java program (in eclipse, the bin directory); and\n4. *Canonical name* of the Main class of program (of the form \\<package-name\\>.\\<class-name\\>). \n**Output**: \n1. A DATE that is a pruned version of Input (2), with which it is enough to monitor Input (3).\n2. Class files of the program with some program statements modified to soundly avoid subsequent [LARVA](http://www.cs.um.edu.mt/svrg/Tools/LARVA/) instrumentation. \nNote that instrumentation is optimised by creating a new class with methods for each method call to be instrumented, and by instrumenting the bytecode of the original Java program by invoking these new methods for events that have been classed as needed to give the same results as the original instrumentation (modulo the input and output DATEs). \n1. One may wish to analyse a program with multiple entry-points. A way to do this would be to create a mock main class that can access each entry-point in a random manner, and use this as the main class for the analysis. \n",
