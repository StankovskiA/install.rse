The Software Engineering (SE) Empirical Standards focus on the first two---they express the SE community's collective expectations for research methodology and reporting. Here _empirical_ denotes research that uses data rather than a mathematical proof or a philosophical treatise. The data can be qualitative or quantitative; real or synthetic. \"Empirical\" does **not** mean \"positivist.\" \nOur empirical standards build on evidence standards from other disciplines, but are significantly more ambitious: \n * Unlike some previous attempts, our standards are method-specific. Software engineering researchers use many different research methods. A single standard for all empirical research would either be biased against some methods or radically incomplete. We have totally different expectations for a controlled experiment and an ethnographic case study. Therefore, the standard for controlled experiments is quite different from the standard for case studies. Our standards cover more methods (and philosophical positions) than any other field's.  \n * Our empirical standards are models of the software engineering community's expectations. That is, most of a standard should appear reasonable to most of the subset of our community that's familiar with that kind of research. The standards should both reflect, and help build, consensus. Therefore, they are hosted on github, and any researcher can report issues and directly implement improvements.\n * Evidence standards can be difficult to apply. Therefore, we have prototyped tools to help authors and reviewers check their manuscripts against relevant standards.\n   \n",

Many of the problems with peer review boiled down to reviewers inventing their own evaluation criteria. Devising appropriate evaluation criteria for any given manuscript is extraordinarily difficult, so most reviewers' criteria are not very good. Reviewers create criteria that are inconsistent with other reviewers', the venue's, the editor's, the methodological literature and---crucially---the author's. In effect, the real criteria by which our research is judged are not merely opaque; they don't even exist until after the manuscript is submitted. This is why peer review is so frustrating, unpredictable, and unscientific. \n\nEmpirical standards are the secret to fixing this situation. With the standards, all the reviewers use the same criteria and the authors know the criteria in advance. Used appropriately, the standards discourage reviewers from either accepting research with fatal flaws or rejecting research based on bogus criteria. \n",
