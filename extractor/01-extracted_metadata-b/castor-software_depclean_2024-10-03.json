This is useful to bypass incomplete result caused by bytecode-level analysis. **For example:** `-DignoreDependencies=\"net.bytebuddy:byte-buddy:.*\",\"com.google.guava.*\"` ignores dependencies with `groupId:artifactId` equals to `net.bytebuddy:byte-buddy` and `groupId` equals to `com.google.guava`. |\n| `<ignoreScopes>`           | `Set<String>` | Add a list of scopes, to be ignored by DepClean during the analysis. Useful to not analyze dependencies with scopes that are not needed at runtime. **Valid scopes are:** `compile`, `provided`, `test`, `runtime`, `system`, `import`. An Empty string indicates no scopes (default).                                                                                                                                    |\n| `<ignoreTests>`            |   `boolean`   | If this is true, DepClean will not analyze the test classes in the project, and, therefore, the dependencies that are only used for testing will be considered unused. This parameter is useful to detect dependencies that have `compile` scope but are only used for testing. **Default value is:** `false`.                                                                                                            |\n| `<createPomDebloated>`     |   `boolean`   | If this is true, DepClean creates a debloated version of the pom without unused dependencies called `debloated-pom.xml`, in the root of the project. **Default value is:** `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| `<createResultJson>`       |   `boolean`   | If this is true, DepClean creates a JSON file of the dependency tree along with metadata of each dependency. The file is called `depclean-results.json`, and is located in the `target` directory of the project. **Default value is:** `false`.                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| `<createCallGraphCsv>`     |   `boolean`   | If this is true, DepClean creates a CSV file with the static call graph of the API members used in the project. The file is called `depclean-callgraph.csv`, and is located in the `target` directory of the project. **Default value is:** `false`.                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| `<failIfUnusedDirect>`     |   `boolean`   | If this is true, and DepClean reported any unused direct dependency in the dependency tree, the build fails immediately after running DepClean. **Default value is:** `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| `<failIfUnusedTransitive>` |   `boolean`   | If this is true, and DepClean reported any unused transitive dependency in the dependency tree, the build fails immediately after running DepClean. **Default value is:** `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| `<failIfUnusedInherited>`  |   `boolean`   | If this is true, and DepClean reported any unused inherited dependency in the dependency tree, the build fails immediately after running DepClean. **Default value is:** `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| `<skipDepClean>`           |   `boolean`   | Skip plugin execution completely. **Default value is:** `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | \n",
