While this rewards artifacts that  are likely more reliable and well-documented, it would also mean missing artifacts rarely used because they are very specific or more recent. \n\nThis work studies popularity bias in Third-Party Library (TPL) RSSEs. First, we investigate whether state-of-the-art research in RSSEs has already tackled the issue of popularity bias. Then, we quantitatively assess 4 existing TPL RSSEs, exploring their capability to deal with the recommendation of popular items. Finally, we propose a mechanism to defuse popularity bias in the recommendation list. The empirical study reveals that the issue of dealing with popularity in TPL RSSEs has not received adequate attention from the software engineering community. Among the surveyed work, only one starts investigating the issue, albeit getting a low prediction performance.\n",

In particular, DS1 was curated\nto evaluate CrossRec, while DS3 (originally named MALib7)\nhas been involved in the experiments of both LibSeek and\nGRec. Finally, we introduced DS2 as an extension of DS1\nto study how the approaches perform by considering a larger\nnumber of libraries. The datasets are summarized in the next table. \nTo give a first idea of how the dataset could cause popularity\nbias, we counted the number of occurrences for each library\nin a dataset, and sorted all the libraries in descending order of\nthis number. The frequency for the libraries of DS1, DS2, and\nDS3 is shown in Fig. 1. As it can be seen, there is always a\nlong tail in all three datasets. For instance, in DS1 the most\npopular library is junit:junit, being included in 969 over 1; 200\nprojects. Meanwhile, the majority of the TPLs are infrequent\ni.e., we count 10; 212 among 13; 497 libraries appearing only\nonce in the whole dataset.\nThe lower part of Table III enumerates the experimental\nconfigurations we considered, where the columns represent\ndatasets, and the rows correspond to systems. A cell is filled\nwith a tick (4) if the tool in the corresponding row is executed\non the dataset in the column, otherwise, it is filled with (7).\nOnly DS2 is used for experiments with all the four tools.
