Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start your experiments!\n\n- Optional step for advanced users: \n\nIn a new terminal window, you can copy the timeseries file you desire to run into the container, \nand then run the following to gain access to the container's file system:\n\n```docker cp <path_to_file> DeepTSF-backend:/app```\n\n```docker exec -it DeepTSF-backend bash```\n\nNow you are running bash in the main DeepTSF container! Choose the directory which best corresponds to your \nproblem, and switch to that: <br>\n- uc2 for general problems. The app will execute a national load forecasting\n  use case if from_database is set to true. So preferrably set from_database=False unless you create your own database connection.<br>\n- uc6 and uc7 are related to other use cases and are still under development.\n\nSo run the following to set up your working environment:\n```cd uc2```\n\n```conda activate DeepTSF_env```\n\n```export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=https://localhost:5000```\n\n```export GIT_PYTHON_REFRESH=quiet```\n\n\nThen, you can execute any experiment you want. An example working command (also demonstrated in the whitepaper [1]), is shown below:\n\n```mlflow run --experiment-name example --entry-point exp_pipeline . -P series_csv=user_datasets/Italy.csv -P convert_to_local_tz=false -P day_first=false -P from_database=false -P multiple=false -P imputation_method=peppanen -P resolution=1h -P rmv_outliers=true -P country=IT -P year_range=2015-2022 -P cut_date_val=20200101 -P cut_date_test=20210101 -P test_end_date=20211231 -P scale=true -P darts_model=NBEATS -P hyperparams_entrypoint=NBEATS_example -P loss_function=mape -P opt_test=true -P grid_search=false -P n_trials=100 -P device=gpu -P ignore_previous_runs=t -P forecast_horizon=24 -P m_mase=24 -P analyze_with_shap=False --env-manager=local```\n\nDon't forget to change series_csv argument to match the file's location in the container \n(if you followed the previous instructions it must be located in the parent directory).\n",
