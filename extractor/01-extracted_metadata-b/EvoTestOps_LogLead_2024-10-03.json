LogLead is an actively evolving project, and we are continually adding new datasets, representations, and classifiers. If there's something you believe should be included, please submit a request for a dataset, enhancer, or classifier in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/EvoTestOps/LogLead/issues). \nA key strength of LogLead is its custom loader system, which efficiently isolates the unique aspects of logs from different systems. This design allows for a reduction in redundant code, as the same enhancement and anomaly detection code can be applied universally once the logs are loaded. \n \n",

These fields enable actions in the subsequent stages. LogLead has loaders to the following public datasets from 10 different systems: \n* 3: [HDFS_v1](https://github.com/logpai/loghub/tree/master/HDFS#hdfs_v1), [Hadoop](https://github.com/logpai/loghub/tree/master/Hadoop), [BGL](https://github.com/logpai/loghub/tree/master/BGL) thanks to amazing [LogHub team](https://github.com/logpai/loghub). For full data see [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/3227177).\n* 3: [Sprit, Thunderbird and Liberty](https://www.usenix.org/cfdr-data#hpc4) can be found from Usenix site.  \n* 2: [Nezha](https://github.com/IntelligentDDS/Nezha) has data from two systems [TrainTicket](https://github.com/FudanSELab/train-ticket) and [Google Cloud Webshop demo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo). It is the first dataset of microservice-based systems. Like other traditional log datasets it has Log data but additionally there are Traces and Metrics.\n* 2: [ADFA](https://github.com/verazuo/a-labelled-version-of-the-ADFA-LD-dataset) and [AWSCTD](https://github.com/DjPasco/AWSCTD) are two datasets designed for intrusion detection.   \n**Enhancer:** This module extracts additional data from logs. The enhancement takes place directly within the dataframes, where new columns are added as a result of the enhancement process. For example, log parsing, the creation of tokens from log messages, and measuring log sequence lengths are all considered forms of log enhancement. Enhancement can happen at the event level or be aggregated to the sequence level. Some of the enhancers available: Event Length (chracters, words, lines), Sequence Length, Sequence [Duration](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars/py-polars/html/reference/api/polars.Duration.html), following \"NLP\" enhancers: [Regex](https://crates.io/crates/regex), [Words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model), [Character n-grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram). Log parsers: [Drain](https://github.com/logpai/Drain3), [LenMa](https://github.com/keiichishima/templateminer), [Spell](https://github.com/bave/pyspell), [IPLoM](https://github.com/EvoTestOps/LogLead/tree/main/parsers/iplom), [AEL](https://github.com/EvoTestOps/LogLead/tree/main/parsers/AEL), [Brain](https://github.com/EvoTestOps/LogLead/tree/main/parsers/Brain), [Fast-IPLoM](https://github.com/EvoTestOps/LogLead/tree/main/parsers/fast_iplom),  [Tipping](https://pypi.org/project/tipping/), and [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert). [NextEventPrediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09214) including its probablities and perplexity. Next event prediction can be computed on top of any of the parser output.  \n**Anomaly Detector:** This module uses the enhanced log data to perform Anomaly Detection. It is mainly using SKlearn at the moment but there are few customer algorithms as well. LogLead has been integrated and tested with following models: \n* Supervised (5): [Decision Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree), [Support Vector Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine), [Logistic Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression), [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest), [eXtreme Gradient Boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost)\n* Unsupervised (4): [One-class SVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine#One-class_SVM), [Local Outlier Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_outlier_factor), [Isolation Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_forest), [K-Means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)\n* Custom Unsupervised (2): [Out-of-Vocabulary Detector](https://github.com/EvoTestOps/LogLead/blob/main/loglead/OOV_detector.py) counts amount words or character n-grams that are novel in test set. [Rarity Model](https://github.com/EvoTestOps/LogLead/blob/main/loglead/RarityModel.py), scores seen words or character n-grams based on their rarity in training set. See our public [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01934) for more details\n \n",
