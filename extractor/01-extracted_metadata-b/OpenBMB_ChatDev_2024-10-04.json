Now you can explore the latest advancements on the [Ebook Website](https://thinkwee.top/multiagent_ebook) and download the [paper list](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev/blob/main/MultiAgentEbook/papers.csv).**\n  <p align=\"center\">\n  <img src='./misc/ebook.png' width=800>\n  </p>\n* June 12, 2024: We introduce Multi-Agent Collaboration Networks (MacNet) \ud83c\udf89, which utilize directed acyclic graphs to facilitate effective task-oriented collaboration among agents through linguistic interactions \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16. MacNet supports cooperation across various topologies and among more than a thousand agents without exceeding context limits. More versatile and scalable, MacNet can be considered a more advanced version of ChatDev's chain-shaped topology. Our preprint paper is available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07155](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07155). This technique will soon be incorporated into this repository, enhancing support for diverse organizational structures and offering richer solutions beyond software development (e.g., logical reasoning, data analysis, story generation, and more).\n  <p align=\"center\">\n  <img src='./misc/macnet.png' width=500>\n  </p> \n* May 07, 2024, we introduced \"Iterative Experience Refinement\" (IER), a novel method where instructor and assistant agents enhance shortcut-oriented experiences to efficiently adapt to new tasks. This approach encompasses experience acquisition, utilization, propagation, and elimination across a series of tasks. Our preprint paper is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04219, and this technique will soon be incorporated into ChatDev.\n  <p align=\"center\">\n  <img src='./misc/ier.png' width=220>\n  </p> \n* October 26, 2023: ChatDev is now supported with Docker for safe execution (thanks to contribution from [ManindraDeMel](https://github.com/ManindraDeMel)). Please see [Docker Start Guide](wiki.md#docker-start).\n  <p align=\"center\">\n  <img src='./misc/docker.png' width=400>\n  </p>\n* September 25, 2023: The **Git** mode is now available, enabling the programmer <img src='visualizer/static/figures/programmer.png' height=20> to utilize Git for version control. To enable this feature, simply set ``\"git_management\"`` to ``\"True\"`` in ``ChatChainConfig.json``. See [guide](wiki.md#git-mode).\n  <p align=\"center\">\n  <img src='./misc/github.png' width=600>\n  </p>\n- September 20, 2023: The **Human-Agent-Interaction** mode is now available! You can get involved with the ChatDev team by playing the role of reviewer <img src='visualizer/static/figures/reviewer.png' height=20> and making suggestions to the programmer <img src='visualizer/static/figures/programmer.png' height=20>;\n  try ``python3 run.py --task [description_of_your_idea] --config \"Human\"``.

Additionally, both online Log mode and replay\n  mode are now supported.\n- July 16, 2023: The [preprint paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07924) associated with this project was published.\n- June 30, 2023: The initial version of the ChatDev repository was released.\n</details>\n \n",

You can create and\n   activate this environment using the following commands, replacing `ChatDev_conda_env` with your preferred environment\n   name: \n   ```\n   conda create -n ChatDev_conda_env python=3.9 -y\n   conda activate ChatDev_conda_env\n   ``` \n3. **Install Dependencies:** Move into the `ChatDev` directory and install the necessary dependencies by running: \n   ```\n   cd ChatDev\n   pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n   ``` \n4. **Set OpenAI API Key:** Export your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. Replace `\"your_OpenAI_API_key\"` with\n   your actual API key. Remember that this environment variable is session-specific, so you need to set it again if you\n   open a new terminal session.\n   On Unix/Linux: \n5. **Build Your Software:** Use the following command to initiate the building of your software,\n   replacing `[description_of_your_idea]` with your idea's description and `[project_name]` with your desired project\n   name:\n   On Unix/Linux: \n   ```\n   python3 run.py --task \"[description_of_your_idea]\" --name \"[project_name]\"\n   ``` \n   ```\n   python run.py --task \"[description_of_your_idea]\" --name \"[project_name]\"\n   ``` \n6. **Run Your Software:** Once generated, you can find your software in the `WareHouse` directory under a specific\n   project folder, such as `project_name_DefaultOrganization_timestamp`. Run your software using the following command\n   within that directory:\n   On Unix/Linux: \n   ```\n   cd WareHouse/project_name_DefaultOrganization_timestamp\n   python3 main.py\n   ``` \n   ```\n   cd WareHouse/project_name_DefaultOrganization_timestamp\n   python main.py\n   ```\n \n",
