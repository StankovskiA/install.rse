In recent years, medical imaging has been increasingly employed to investigate \npatterns of neural activity associated with coding activity. \nHowever, such studies have focused on advanced undergraduates\nand professionals. In a human study of 31 participants,\nwe use functional near-infrared spectroscopy to \nmeasure the neural activity associated with introductory\nprogramming. In a controlled, contrast-based experiment,\nwe relate brain activity when coding \nto that of reading natural language or mentally rotating objects \n(a spatial visualization task). \nOur primary result is that all three tasks---coding, \nprose reading, and mental rotation---are mentally distinct\nfor novices. \nHowever, while those tasks are neurally distinct, \nwe find more significant differences between prose and\ncoding than between mental rotation and coding. \nIntriguingly, we generally find\nmore activation in areas of the brain associated with spatial ability \nand task difficulty for novice coding compared to that reported in studies with\nmore expert developers.\nFinally, in an exploratory analysis, we also find a neural activation\npattern predictive of performance weeks later. \nWhile preliminary, these findings both expand on\nprevious results (e.g., relating expertise to a similarity\nbetween coding and prose reading) and also provide a\nnew understanding of the cognitive processes underlying\nnovice programming.\n",
