This avoids situations where\n  performance changes are due to changes to a specially crafted AMI, generated by scripts in another\n  repo, by a person on a different team.\n* Globally shared, \"normalized\" config: All DSI binaries always read the entire set of config files.\n  For example, mongodb_setup.py will use the same SSH key as terraform used in\n  infrastructure_provisioning.py. \nYou use DSI by creating a work directory and putting some configuration files into it. (At least\nonce upon a time it was even possible to run all DSI commands using just defaults, without any\nconfiguration files.) This directory will also hold your terraform tfstate files, benchmark output,\nlogs, etc... \nA helper script [bin/bootstrap.py](bin/bootstrap.py) is a convenient way to create a directory and\ncopy some canned configuration files into it. In fact, we almost always use files available under\n[configurations/](configurations/). You list the combination of configs you want to use in a simple\n`bootstrap.yml` file. See\n[configurations/bootstrap.example.yml](configurations/bootstrap.example.yml) to get started! \nThe second level is split into one file per section, but are logically a single\nconfiguration. The reason for splitting into multiple files is modularity: Whether you want to\ndeploy a 1-node or 3-node replica set, you can use the same test_control.yml with both. \n",
