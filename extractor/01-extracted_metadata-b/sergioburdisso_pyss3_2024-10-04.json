These tools let you analyze, monitor and understand your models by allowing you to see what they have actually learned and why.

                "value": "This is probably one of the most useful components of PySS3. As the name suggests, this class provides the user easy-to-use methods for model evaluation and hyperparameter optimization, like, for example, the [``test``](https://pyss3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html#pyss3.util.Evaluation.test), [``kfold_cross_validation``](https://pyss3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html#pyss3.util.Evaluation.kfold_cross_validation), [``grid_search``](https://pyss3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html#pyss3.util.Evaluation.grid_search), and [``plot``](https://pyss3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html#pyss3.util.Evaluation.plot) methods for performing tests, stratified k-fold cross validations, grid searches for hyperparameter optimization, and visualizing evaluation results using an interactive 3D plot, respectively. Probably one of its most important features is the ability to automatically (and permanently) record the history of evaluations that you've performed. This will save you a lot of time and will allow you to interactively visualize and analyze your classifier performance in terms of its different hyper-parameters values (and select the best model according to your needs). For instance, let's perform a grid search with a 4-fold cross-validation on the three [hyperparameters](https://pyss3.rtfd.io/en/latest/user_guide/ss3-classifier.html#hyperparameters), smoothness(`s`), significance(`l`), and sanction(`p`):\n```python\nfrom pyss3.util import Evaluation\n\nbest_s, best_l, best_p, _ = Evaluation.grid_search(\n    clf, x_train, y_train,\n    s=[0.2, 0.32, 0.44, 0.56, 0.68, 0.8],\n    l=[0.1, 0.48, 0.86, 1.24, 1.62, 2],\n    p=[0.5, 0.8, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, 2],\n    k_fold=4\n)\n```\nIn this illustrative example, `s`, `l`, and `p` will take those 6 different values each, and once the search is over, this function will return (by default) the hyperparameter values that obtained the best accuracy.\nNow, we could also use the ``plot`` function to analyze the results obtained in our grid search using the interactive 3D evaluation plot:\n \nIn this 3D plot, each point represents an experiment/evaluation performed using that particular combination of values (`s`, `l`, and `p`). Also, these points are painted proportional to how good the performance was according to the selected metric; the plot will update \"on the fly\" when the user select a different evaluation metric (accuracy, precision, recall, f1, etc.). Additionally, when the cursor is moved over a data point, useful information is shown (including a \"compact\" representation of the confusion matrix obtained in that experiment). Finally, it is worth mentioning that, before showing the 3D plots, PySS3 creates a single and portable HTML file in your project folder containing the interactive plots. This allows users to store, send or upload the plots to another place using this single HTML file. For example, we have uploaded two of these files for you to see: [\"Sentiment Analysis (Movie Reviews)\"](https://pyss3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/ss3_model_evaluation[movie_review_3grams].html) and [\"Topic Categorization\"](https://pyss3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/ss3_model_evaluation[topic_categorization_3grams].html), both evaluation plots were also obtained following the [tutorials](https://pyss3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/getting-started.html#tutorials). \n",
