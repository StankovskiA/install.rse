In the Quick Start section, we include a pretrained embedding file in the downloaded folders. If you would like to retrain the embedding (or **you have a new dataset**), please follow the steps below.\n\n1. Create a directory named ```${dataset}``` under the main folder (e.g., ```./bio```).\n\n2. Prepare three files:             \n(1) ```./${dataset}/label_hier.txt``` indicating the parent children relationships between classes. The first class of each line is the parent class, followed by all its children classes. **The root class must be named as ROOT.** Tab is used as the delimiter.           \n(2) ```./${dataset}/keywords.txt``` containing class-related keywords for each leaf class. Each line has a class name and a keyword.           \n(3) ```./${dataset}/${json-name}.json```. **You can refer to the provided [json files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11zIqAg062IneYNdqfTMBV00n7weyvKbR/view?usp=sharing) for the format. All fields except \"repo\" are required.**\n\n3. Install the dependencies [**GSL**](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) and [**Eigen**](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). For Eigen, we already provide a zip file ```ESim/eigen-3.3.3.zip```. You can directly unzip it in ```ESim/```. For GSL, you can download it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UvmgrZbycC7wYAHahYGRB5pRtu6Aurhv/view?usp=sharing).\n\n4. ```./prep_emb.sh```. Make sure you change the dataset/json names.\n\nAfter that, you can train the classifier as mentioned in Quick Start (i.e., ```./test.sh```).\nPlease always refer to the example datasets when adapting the code for a new dataset.\n",
