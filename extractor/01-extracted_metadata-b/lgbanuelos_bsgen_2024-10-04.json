As you will see, it is assume the input Petri nets should be located in a folder which must be specified in line 225 (variable `input_dir`). Provide also a target directory setting the variable `output_dir` accordingly. Assumming you have all the required software properly installed, you would just need to execute from a terminal window the following command:\n\n```\npython3 bsgen.py\n```\n\nNote that the computation is long lasting.

One quality criterion\nfor discovered process models is generalization. Generalization seeks to quantify how well the discovered model describes future\nexecutions of the system, and is perhaps the least understood quality criterion in process mining. The lack of understanding\nis primarily a consequence of generalization seeking to measure properties over the entire future behavior of the system, when the\nonly available sample of behavior is that provided by the event log itself. In this paper, we draw inspiration from computational\nstatistics, and employ a bootstrap approach to estimate properties of a population based on a sample. Specifically, we define an\nestimator of the model\u2019s generalization based on the event log it was discovered from, and then use bootstrapping to measure the\ngeneralization of the model with respect to the system, and its statistical significance. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility\nof the approach in industrial settings. \nThis Git repository contains the code, implementing the method and experiment described in the paper: \nArtem Polyvyanyy, Alistair Moffat and Luciano Garc\u00eda-Ba\u00f1uelos, Bootstrapping Generalization of Process Models Discovered From Event Data, [CoRR abs/2107.03876](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03876) (2021)\n \n",
