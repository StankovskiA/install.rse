In particular, we design an unsupervised pretext task by generating textually divergent copies of source functions via automated source-to-source compiler transforms that preserve semantics. We train a neural model to identify variants of an anchor program within a large batch of negatives. To solve this task, the network must extract program features representing the functionality, not form, of the program. This is the first application of instance discrimination to code representation learning to our knowledge. We pre-train ContraCode over 1.8m unannotated JavaScript methods mined from GitHub. ContraCode pre-training improves code summarization accuracy by 7.9% over supervised approaches and 4.8% over BERT pre-training. Moreover, our approach is agnostic to model architecture; for a type prediction task, contrastive pre-training consistently improves the accuracy of existing baselines. \nThis repository contains code to augment JavaScript programs with code transformations, pre-train LSTM and Transformer models with ContraCode, and to finetune the models on downstream tasks. \n",
