In: Motahari-Nezhad, H.R., Recker, J.,Weidlich, M. (eds.) BPM\n2015. LNCS, vol. 9253, pp. 406 - 422. Springer, Heidelberg (2015)\n\nWe then inject noises into the logs by adding and removing events.\n\nThere are 10 rounds for each noise level.\n\nFor example Round1 contains the first round for adding 10%, 20%, 30% events\n\nRound1R contains the first round for removing 10%, 20%, 30% events\n\nRound 0 contains the 68 noise-free event logs\n\n*In order to stream the events in the order described in the paper, we shift the timestamps for the events.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe evaluation results can be found in the \"Evaluation_results.zip\" file. \n\nFor the file names of evaluation results of our algorithm. The number after \"w\" refers to the window size, and the number after \"o\" refers to the number of consecutive tests. For example, the results in the folder \"add-w1500-o2\" refers to the evaluation on the artificial logs with added events as noises. The windowSize is set to 1500, and numOfConsecutiveTests = windowSize / 2.\n\nFor the csv files containing evaluation results. The number after n refers to the noise level, the number after R refers to the round of the data (there are 10 rounds for each noise level for each log). For example \"R1-IOR-w1500-n0.3-o2.csv\" refers to the evaluation results for change pattern \"IOR\" with noise level 0.3 using the data generated in the first round. (windowsize 1500, numOfConsecutiveTests = windowSize / 2)\n\n\nThe code we use to generate noises in event logs can also be downloaded from:\n\nhttps://unisydneyedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/yalu8986_uni_sydney_edu_au/EReEpTVgjuhBs0r-xdM4bh0BkAyYermc01I2dGdDXXU7FQ?e=z62mGv\n\n"
