First, we separate code independent \nannotation changes (annotation changes that are not related with other code changes) form code consistent annotation changes (annotation\nchanges that are related with other code changes). Code independent annotation changes are are likely to reflect more directly developers\u2019 concerns \nover the annotations (missing annotations or problems with existing annotations). Change instances correspond to \"nbUseAE\", \"nbUseDE\", \"nbUseC\",\nand \"nbUseU\" are likely to be code independent annotation changesare, and we further use some heuristics to eliminate potential code consistent \nannotation changes among them. After that, we sample 384 instances for each of them and study the characteristics of them, such as the reason\nbehind the changes and what in detail are the changes. The results are summaried in csv files ANNOTATION-ADD-SAMPLE, ANNOTATION-CHANGE-SAMPLE,\nANNOTATION-DELETE-SAMPLE, and ANNOTATION-UPDATE-SAMPLE. These files contain columns like \"Repository Name\", \"Commit Link\", \"File Name\",\n\"Involved Annotation\", \"Reason\", \"Behavior\", and \"Remark\".  \nSecond, we find that nearly three-quarter of the assigned annotation values are typed as\nString, and the String content could actually be better typed (for instance, as Class or Primitive) in some cases. We doubt types of some \nannotation members are wrongly designed as String. We sample some String type annotation members for which the assigned annotation values match\nwith Primitive and class name, and manually check them. We find that there are truly many wrongly designed String types. The results are\nsummarized in csv files String-Type-Annotation-Member-Check (Assigned Value Matches with Class Name) and String-Type-Annotation-Member-Check\n(Assigned Value Matches with Primitive).
