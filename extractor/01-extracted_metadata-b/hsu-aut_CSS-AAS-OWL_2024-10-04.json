The approach is built on the current version of the AAS submodel specifications for \"Capability\" and \"Control Component\" as defined by the [IDTA](https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/en/content-hub/submodels) and our [capability and skill ontology for manufacturing](https://github.com/aljoshakoecher/caskman).\nThere is currently not a dedicated bidirectional mapping approach for AAS / JSON and ontologies. Thus, the following two unidirectional mapping approaches are combined to have mappings for both directions:\n- [RDF Mapping Language (RML)](https://rml.io/) is used to map an AAS in JSON serialization into an ontology. All RML mapping rules are provided in the directory `rml`.\n- [RDF Mappings to Exchange Formats (RDFex)](https://github.com/hsu-aut/rdfex) are used for the inverse direction, i.e., to map from an ontology to an AAS in JSON serialization. Please note, that the ontology must adher to [our ontology](https://github.com/aljoshakoecher/caskman). All RDFex mapping rules are provided in the directory `rdfex`. \n",
