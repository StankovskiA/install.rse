However, training involves a message passing algorithm where nodes only communicate with their neighbors. The ability to learn long-range dependencies is limited by the number of message passing iterations, which are typically set to a small number (e.g., less than eight) due to computational cost. Such a limitation will result in an inherently local model. In contrast, Transformer allows global, program-wise information aggregation, and without pre-defined edges, the self-attention mechanism of Transformer is expected to encode considerable code semantics \u2013 which can be complementary to those defined explicitly by the code graph. Therefore, to learn the diversity of vulnerable patterns, we separately train these two distinct models and use their predictions in an ensemble learning setting at inference time. \n",
