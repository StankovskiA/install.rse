                "value": "To run the project, there are three phases, each requiring a different python file to be executed. The first phase is handled by `first_run.py`, the second by `second_run.py`, and the third by `third_run.py`. Additionally, the project has three different datasets available: `EclipseJDT`, `GCC`, and Mozilla`.\n\nBefore running the code, the datasets should be unzipped. \n\n`first_run.py` performs the training and testing of the model and extracts LDA categories, assignment time, and SVM models. It accepts the following arguments:\n\n* `--project`: Specifies the name of the project to run. It accepts a string value from the list: `[LibreOffice, Mozilla, EclipseJDT, GCC]`. Default value is `EclipseJDT`.\n* `--verbose`: Specifies the verbosity of the output. It accepts integer values from 0 to 2 or string values of `[nothing, some, all]`. The default value is 0.\n\nAn example of running `first_run.py` for EclipseJDT project is as follows:\n\n```terminal\npython3.9 simulator/first_run.py --project=EclipseJDT\n```\n\nThe second phase can be run using `second_run.py`. This phase estimates the state transitions by running the model for the training phase once. The arguments for this phase are similar to the first phase, as follows:\n\n* `--project`: It specifies the dataset to use, and it can be selected from the list of available datasets: `[LibreOffice, Mozilla, EclipseJDT, GCC]`.\n* `--verbose`: It determines the level of verbosity of the output. It can be either: `[0, 1, 2, nothing, some, all]`.\n\nHere's an example of how to run the second phase for the EclipseJDT dataset:\n```terminal\npython3.9 simulator/second_run.py --project=EclipseJDT\n```\n\nThe third phase can be run using `third_run.py`, which implements the Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) algorithm. This phase has many arguments that you can set to customize the algorithm's behavior. Here are the arguments for this phase:\n\n* `--project`: It specifies the dataset to use, and it can be selected from the list of available datasets: `[LibreOffice, Mozilla, EclipseJDT, GCC]`.\n* `--verbose`: It determines the level of verbosity of the output. It can be either: `[0, 1, 2, nothing, some, all]`.\n* `--epochs_training`: It specifies the number of epochs for the training phase.\n* `--epochs_testing`: It specifies the number of epochs for the testing phase.\n* `--project_horizon`: It specifies the number of days for each epoch.\n* `--method`: It indicates which approach we want to use.\n* `--alpha_update`: It indicates how to update alpha in the ADP algorithm for this set `[constant, harmonic, bakf]`.\n* `--alpha`: It is the alpha value for the constant case.\n* `--early_asg_cost`: It specifies whether to impose a cost for early assignments.\n* `--gamma`: It is the discounting coefficient of the Bellman equation.\n* `--epsilon`: It is the ratio of exploration (e-greedy approach). 1 means no exploration.\n* `--cost_f`: It specifies how the cost function of the late assignment should be.\n* `--idea`: It specifies which idea to use: (a) Sophisticated, (b) Simplified.\n* `--toy_example`: It specifies whether it is a toy example.\n\nHere's an example of how to run the third phase for the EclipseJDT dataset:\n\n```terminal\npython3.9 simulator/third_run.py --project=EclipseJDT --epochs_training=20000 --epochs_testing=100 --method=ADP --alpha_update=Constant --early_asg_cost=False --gamma=0.9 --epsilon=0.25 --cost_f=exponential\n```\n\nIn this example, the ADP algorithm is used with constant alpha, no cost for early assignments, a discounting coefficient of 0.9, an exploration ratio of 0.25, and an exponential cost function for late assignments. The training phase will run for 20000 epochs, and the testing phase will run for 100 epochs. The dataset used is EclipseJDT.\n\n\n",
