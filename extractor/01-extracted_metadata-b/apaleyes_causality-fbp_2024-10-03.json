In each project we setup experiments in which we introduce some disturbance in the system , either changing its logic or shifting the input distribution. We then observe the shift in the output, and compute attributions scores of each node in the dataflow graph. Attribution score reflects how much a given node impacted the overall output distribution shift. The experiment succeeds if the node at which we intervened received the highest attribution score. \n",
