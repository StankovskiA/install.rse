The propagate function was the one that needed to be optimized as it accounts for approximately 75% of the total\nexecution time.</br>\n2.) Assigned a machine independent attribute - call id for every call to replace the default execution time of the call with\nthe optimized input.</br>\n3.) Graph between the percentage reduction of propagate() vs percentage reduction of total time due to propagate() illustrated that the decrease in total time is exponential and time taken by propagate can be reduced only up-to a certain\npoint(76%) as then, the total execution time starts increasing, thus nullifying the effect of parallelism.</br>\nSimilar analysis of other complex variants of SAT like graph coloring are under progress.</br>\nFor more detailed analysis on how the profiling was carried out, what all changes were made to GPROF to form AccEx and what is the importance of these results are all illustrated in https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13058\n \n",
