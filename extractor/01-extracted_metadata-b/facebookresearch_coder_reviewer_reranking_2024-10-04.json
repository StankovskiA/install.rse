Effective Technological Measures means those measures that,\n        in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented\n        under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO\n        Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar\n        international agreements.\n    -   e.

License grant.\n        -   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public\n            License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,\n            royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable\n            license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed\n            Material to:\n            -   A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole\n                or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and\n            -   B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for\n                NonCommercial purposes only.\n        -   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt,\n            where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this\n            Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply\n            with its terms and conditions.\n        -   3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in\n            Section 6(a).\n        -   4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n            Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n            all media and formats whether now known or hereafter\n            created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do\n            so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any\n            right or authority to forbid You from making technical\n            modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,\n            including technical modifications necessary to circumvent\n            Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this\n            Public License, simply making modifications authorized by\n            this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n        -   5. Downstream recipients.\n            -   A. Offer from the Licensor \u2013 Licensed Material. Every\n                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n                Public License.\n            -   B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or\n                impose any additional or different terms or conditions\n                on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to,\n                the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of\n                the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n                Material.\n        -   6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License\n            constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or\n            imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed\n            Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or\n            granted official status by, the Licensor or others\n            designated to receive attribution as provided in Section\n            3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n    -   b. Other rights.\n        -   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n            licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n            privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however,\n            to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees\n            not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the\n            limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the\n            Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n        -   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n            Public License.\n        -   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n            collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n            Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n            under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n            licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n            reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when\n            the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial\n            purposes.\n\n-   Section 3 \u2013 License Conditions.\n\n    Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to\n    the following conditions.\n\n    -   a. Attribution.\n        -   1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n            form), You must:\n            -   A. retain the following if it is supplied by the\n                Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n                -   i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n                -   ii. a copyright notice;\n                -   iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n                -   iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n                -   v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to\n                    the extent reasonably practicable;\n            -   B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n            -   C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n                hyperlink to, this Public License.\n        -   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n            reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n            which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may\n            be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI\n            or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n            information.\n        -   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n            information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n            reasonably practicable.\n        -   4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n            License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n            Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n-   Section 4 \u2013 Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\n    Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\n    apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n    -   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the\n        right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a\n        substantial portion of the contents of the database for\n        NonCommercial purposes only;\n    -   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n        contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n        Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n        Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material;\n        and\n    -   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You\n        Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the\n        database.\n\n    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\n    replace Your obligations under this Public License where the\n    Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n-   Section 5 \u2013 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n    -   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to\n        the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material\n        as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or\n        warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether\n        express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without\n        limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a\n        particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other\n        defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether\n        or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties\n        are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not\n        apply to You.\n    -   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be\n        liable to You on any legal theory (including, without\n        limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special,\n        indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or\n        other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this\n        Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the\n        Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses,\n        costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is\n        not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to\n        You.\n    -   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability\n        provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the\n        extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute\n        disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n-   Section 6 \u2013 Term and Termination.\n\n    -   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n        Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply\n        with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public\n        License terminate automatically.\n    -   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated\n        under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n        -   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured,\n            provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n            violation; or\n        -   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect\n        any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your\n        violations of this Public License.\n\n    -   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n        Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n        distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing\n        so will not terminate this Public License.\n    -   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n        License.\n\n-   Section 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n    -   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or\n        different terms or conditions communicated by You unless\n        expressly agreed.\n    -   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n        Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n        independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n-   Section 8 \u2013 Interpretation.\n\n    -   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n        shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n        conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could\n        lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n    -   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public\n        License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically\n        reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.\n        If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from\n        this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the\n        remaining terms and conditions.\n    -   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived\n        and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to\n        by the Licensor.\n    -   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be\n        interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges\n        and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from\n        the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.
