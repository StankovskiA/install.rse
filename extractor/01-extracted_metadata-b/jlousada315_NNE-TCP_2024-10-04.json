Drops tests/files from data that cause less than threshold transitions/modifications, i.e. very stable tests/files.\n* **ML Input:** Create unified input data for ML algorithm, where columns are (revision, mod_files (list)  and test names (list). Then we want to create pairs of the form (file, test). For each revision, the lists above are exploded to make pair-wise combinations between elements. Now we need to create a training set.\n* **DataGenerator:** Generates data for Keras Model. Receives pairs of (files, tests) and generates random combinations of (file, test, label). Where the label is either 1 if the pair exists in the data or 0 otherwise. The class balance is given by the negative_ratio parameter, if parameter is 1, class balance is 50% each.\n* **Keras Model:** Neural Network Embeddings depicted below.\n* **Evaluation:** Once the model is trained. When new revisions arrive, it is able to predict which tests will more likely be linked to the modified files and create a more meaningful test ordering to detect faults earlier.
