These notebooks have been widely adopted through \nnotebook software such as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [Datalore](https://www.jetbrains.com/datalore/) and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), both in academia and industry. While there is extensive research to learn  how data scientists use computational notebooks, identify their pain points, and enable collaborative data science practices, very little is known about the various accessibility barriers experienced by blind and visually impaired (BVI) users using these notebooks. BVI users are unable to use computational notebook interfaces due to inaccessibility of the interface, common ways in which data is represented in these interfaces, and inability for popular libraries to provide accessible outputs. \nWe perform a large scale systematic analysis of a randomly chosen set of 100000 Jupyter notebooks, a subset of a large [dataset of ten million notebooks](https://blog.jetbrains.com/datalore/2020/12/17/we-downloaded-10-000-000-jupyter-notebooks-from-github-this-is-what-we-learned/) provided by JetBrains, to identify various accessibility challenges in published notebooks affecting the creation and consumption of these notebooks. Through our findings, we make recommendations to improve accessibility of the artifacts of a notebook, suggest authoring practices, and propose changes to infrastructure to make notebooks accesible. Please read our paper to gain an in-depth understanding of our findings. \n",

We recommend using VS Code to read through the cell content of the notebooks we share. We recommend exporting the notebooks to HTML if you wish to  access the outputs as well. VS Code comes with the ability to provide audio notifications to indicate the completion of a cell's execution, and if the completion is successful. We recommend running the notebooks one cell at a time.\n2. **Exporting notebooks**: An alternate accessible workflow to work with notebooks would be to export them to python scripts. Informed by the experience of our team member who uses a screen reader, this especially may be helpful to edit code. We recommend using the [percent format](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats-scripts.html) as it may be easy to read, and is well-supported by a variety of IDEs including VS Code.\n3. **Working with Python scripts**: Most of our pipeline contains standard python scripts which are executed by running `python <example>.py`. Some of these scripts however may take time to run so please refer to the provided [documentation](pipeline/README.md) carefully before running the scripts. We provided time estimates for each script in our pipeline.\n4. **Working with our data**: All of our data is formatted as comma separated values (CSV) files. Some files however may be large and can cause screen readers or IDEs to crash. While there is no threshold to identify crashes, we recommend running `wc -l 'file.csv'` to get an estimate of the number of rows in the file. An easy way to access the data columns of the file would be to run `head -n 1 'file.csv'`. This prints the first line of the csv file that contains the column headers.\n \n",
