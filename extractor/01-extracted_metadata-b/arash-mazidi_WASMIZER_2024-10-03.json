Repository collection_\r\n\r\nIt identifies C and C++ projects on GitHub using Github search API (https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search?apiVersion=2022-11-28). There are some limitations on the search API such as rate limitation that we make a delay between requests to overcome this limitation. Another limitation is the maximum number of retrieved repositories in the search API that is 1000. We overcome this limitation by defining short period of date to have less than 1000 repositories. In addition, each page includes 100 repositories and we use a loop to have repositories in all pages.\r\nWe excluded the forks of another repository to prevent duplicate projects.\r\nWe had to select GitHub projects as, practically, we cannot analyse all the C or C++ projects. Therefore, we set up several selection criteria such as WebAssembly-related keywords, minimum number of stars and forks, minimum size of the projects, date of the last pushed, and WebAssembly symptoms in the config.json. It firstly collect projects based on the keywords, then filters the projects based on the symptoms in their code.\r\n\r\n_2. Compilation_\r\n\r\nIn the compilation phase, Wasmizer clones the target repositories as long as they are not already compiled or it is pushed after the previous compilation date. We need to install the necessary tools for compilation and build tools. As Wasmizer is initially built to compile C/C++ projects to WebAssembly and therefore we use Emscripten (https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html | We used Docker image). In addition, In addition, in order to convert wat files to wasm files, you need to install wat2wasm tool. You can use https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt for this goal. \r\nIt then searches for precompilation and compilation source files and automatically compiles each project based on the compilation commands. We identified each CMakeLists.txt file, indicating the use of the cmake build system, we run Emscripten\u2019s cmake wrapper (emcmake). Then, for each Makefile, either resulting from the previous step, or standalone, we run Emscripten\u2019s make wrapper (emmake). It should be noted, compilation source files and commands are stored in the config.json file. Therefore, Wasmizer can be adapted to a different language such as rust by replacing the compilation commands in the config.json file. We also use github commit API in order to retrieve the commit sha of the projects. We consider the latest commit, so the first commit in the retrieved list will be the target commit. Then, we get the commit sha and store it in the metadata.csv file. \r\n\r\nAfter applying the compilation phase to all projects, it looks for files that are named with either a .wasm or a .wat extension, indicating that they are WebAssembly files. We try to convert all .wat files found into their binary version (.wasm) relying on the wat2wasm tool from the WebAssembly Binary Toolkit, configured with the --enable-all flag to enable all available WebAssembly extensions. We then store all .wasm files in a new directory (wasm-wat-files), under a name composed of the SHA-256 sum of their content. This is to ensure that duplicate files are only present once in the dataset. We store a metadata.csv contains information of the binary files such as name, url, forks, stars, size, creation date, last commit date, commit sha etc.\r\nWasmizer also separates the binary files that were already exist and new generated binary files in two folders (wasm-wat-files-pre and wasm-wat-files). \r\n\r\n\r \n",
