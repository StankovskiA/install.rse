The project uses the [GHTorrent MySQL database from June 2019](https://ghtorrent.org/downloads.html). We examine how the behavior of software developers changes in response to removing gamification elements from GitHub, an online platform for collaborative programming and software development. We find that the unannounced removal of daily activity streak counters from the user interface (from user profile pages) was followed by significant changes in behavior. Long-running streaks of activity were abandoned and became less common. Weekend activity decreased and days in which developers made a single contribution became less common. Synchronization of streaking behavior in the platform's social network also decreased, suggesting that gamification is a powerful channel for social influence. Focusing on a set of software developers that were publicly pursuing a goal to make contributions for 100 days in a row, we find that some of these developers abandon this quest following the removal of the public streak counter. Our findings provide evidence for the significant impact of gamification on the behavior of developers on large collaborative programming and software development platforms. They urge caution: gamification can steer the behavior of software developers in unexpected and unwanted directions.\n\n\n--- \n* The ICSE 2021 paper (11 pages) is available [>>here<<](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/icse/2021/029600a549/1sEXoczR0TC) .\n* SE2022 summary (2 pages) is available [>>here<<](https://dl.gi.de/handle/20.500.12116/37976) .\n* The arxiv preprint (11 pages) is available [>>here<<](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02371) .\n* The thesis paper (50 pages) is available [>>here<<](https://johanneswachs.com/papers/BachelorMoldon.pdf) .\n---\n\n[![How Gamification Affects Software Developers:Cautionary Evidence from a Natural Experiment on GitHub](https://img.youtube.com/vi/lR8DpCNQNBU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR8DpCNQNBU)\n",

This will be used to facilitate filtering for active users.\n5. Use the counted commits per user and *reduceUsers.py* to filter out users with less than X commits in their lifetime on GitHub from the *users.csv*. The script creates a database of remaining users with personal information including the username, account creation date, status and location.\n6. Filter the commit data from *commits.csv* with *reduceCommits.py*, as we only want the data of users in our new user subset and commits in non-forked projects (uses data from step 2 and 5).\n7. Compute the size of the filtered user subset for each day with *getUsergroupsize.py*. This will be used for average value calculations in **streak_advanced**.\n8. Filter the issue data from *issues.csv* with *reduceIssues.py* and with the same restrictions from step 6, as issues and pull-requests in/to non-forked projects also counted for the streak feature.  \n9. Create a database including all types of contributions (commits, pull-requests, issues) assigned to the filtered subset of users with *getContributionPerUser.py*.\n10. Create the final streak database using *getStreaks.py*. All contributions get sorted and transformed in the users local timezone, such that the resulting list contains streaks with a start and an end day for each user. \nA graphical representation of the described process and the dependencies between the files can be found below, a detailed description of each script including output examples can be found in *overview.xlsx*.
