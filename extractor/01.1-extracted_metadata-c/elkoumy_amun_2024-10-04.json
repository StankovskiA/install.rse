                "value": "- Amun proposes a framework to anonymize event logs to the extent that no individual can be singled out using the anonymized log. It anonymizes event logs in order to guarantee that, upon the disclosure of the anonymized log, the probability that an attacker may single out any individual represented in the original log, does not increase by more than a threshold. Amun proposes a differentially private disclosure mechanism, which oversamples the cases in the log and adds noise to the timestamps to the extent required to achieve the above privacy guarantee. An emperical evaluation of Amun using 14 real-world event logs can be found in our recent [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9576852). Also, Amun supports other anonymization approaches such as sampling and filtering, which are presented in the [journal extension paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03010.pdf).\n- Amun uses a mathematically proven privacy model to \n  balance the risk correlated with publishing process models and the utility after anonymization.\n  It uses an \u03b5-differential-privacy mechanism to anonymize Directly-Follows Graphs (DFGs).\n  It provides a mathematical approach to calculate the value of \u03b5 that represents the amount of noise \n  injected a process mining model that optimizes the risk and utility measures. \n  Amun keeps all the traces and all the activities of a DFG. \n  An emperical evaluation of Amun using 13 real-world event logs could be found in our recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.01119.pdf). \n",
