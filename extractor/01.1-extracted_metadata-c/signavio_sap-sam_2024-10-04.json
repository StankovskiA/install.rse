Place the files in `./data/raw/sap_sam_2022/models` and the conversion will be performed automatically.\n\nTo get started on Mac or Windows, we provide a dependency setup with `poetry`.\nMake sure poetry is installed on your system with `poetry --version`. If not, run `pip poetry install`.\n\nTo install the dependencies,  do  to the root of the cloned repository, type this line in the terminal, and press enter:\n```shell\npoetry install\n```\n\n> It is important to note that you should have the latest stable version of `python` or `python3` installed on your machine, and not a pre-release one (try `python --version`). The current latest stable version is `3.12.5` (as of August 2024).\n\nAfter executing the script, you should be able to setup the kernel:\n```shell\npoetry run python -m ipykernel install --user --name=sap-sam-kernel\n```\nThen, to open the project, simply type:\n```shell\npoetry run jupyter notebook\n```\n\nAlternatively, a **conda** setup is possible.\n\nWe provide two [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html) environment.yml files that can be used to create a new environment and install the required dependencies:\n- `environment.yml`: contains the abstract dependencies (pandas, numpy, ...).\n- `environment-lock.yml`: contains versions for all dependencies and the transitive dependencies to ensure reproducible results.\n\nYou can use the following conda command to create the environment:\n```shell\nconda env create -f environment.yml  \n```\nor\n```shell\nconda env create -f environment-lock.yml  \n```\n",
