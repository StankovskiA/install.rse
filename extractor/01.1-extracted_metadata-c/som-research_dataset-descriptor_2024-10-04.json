The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved and how your contribution will be considered.\n\n## Asking Questions \n\nDo you have a question? Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/SOM-Research/DescribeML/issues/new?assignees=&labels=question&template=question.md).\n\nProject maintainers will be eager to listen from you and help you out. Please, try to compose a clear and concise question. The more information you provide, the better we will be able to help you.\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nDo you have you identified a reproducible problem in our code? or have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Please follow the next steps:\n\n### Look For an Existing Issue\n\nSometimes the issue you want to report is being already addressed, or is planned to be addressed soon. Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/SOM-Research/DescribeML/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.\n\nIf you find your issue already exists, do not hesittate to make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Please, use a reaction in place of a \"+1\" comment, we believe it's easy: \ud83d\udc4d for upvoting and \ud83d\udc4e for downvoting.\n\nIf you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, [create a new issue](https://github.com/SOM-Research/DescribeML/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=proposal.md). The template will guide you on the issue reporting.\n\n### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests\n\nWhenever possible, we ask you to file a single issue per problem and feature request. Please do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue, as it may be hard to track the progress.\n\nAs you can imagine, the more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.\n\n### Creating Pull Requests\n\nPlease refer to the article on [creating pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute#pull-requests) before contributing to this project.\n\n### Governance\n\nAny contribution you send to us will be addressed by the project maintainers following the governance rules described in the [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md)\n\n# Thank You!\n\nYour contributions to open source, large or small, make great projects like this possible. Thank you for taking the time to contribute.\n",

You may not want to dive in it as it is a generated asset\n  - The *generator-service* folder contains all the code of the generation service. Could be a good place to start if you want to improve the generation of the tool.\n  - The *uploader-service* folder contains all the code of the uploader service. Could be a good place to contribute new statistical metrics, or ML techniques to do dataset reverse engineering\n  - The *language-server* folder contains all the language features, and the grammar declaration. If you want to improve the grammar, or some of the features the plugin offers here is the place you may want to start\n    - The *dataset-description.langium* file contains the main grammar declaration.
