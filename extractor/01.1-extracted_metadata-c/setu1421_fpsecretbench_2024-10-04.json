Though many open-source and proprietary secret detection tools are available, these tools output many false positives, making it difficult for developers to take action and teams to choose one tool out of many. To our knowledge, the secret detection tools are not yet compared and evaluated. The goal of our study is to aid developers in choosing a secret detection tool to reduce the exposure of secrets through an empirical investigation of existing secret detection tools. We present an evaluation of five open-source and four proprietary tools against a benchmark dataset.\n\n**In addition to comparing nine secret detection tools, we have curated a dataset *FPSecretBench*, which contains the false positives reported by the secret detection tools scanned on the benchmark dataset ([SecretBench](https://github.com/setu1421/SecretBench)). The dataset will aid in expediting the research on improving the accuracy of the tools.** \n",
