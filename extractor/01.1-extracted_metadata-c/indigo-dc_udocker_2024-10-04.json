                "value": "# Installation and configuration manual\n\nIn most cases the end user can download and execute udocker without\nsystem administrator intervention. udocker itself is written in Python, but\nalso uses external binaries and libraries to provide a chroot like\nenvironment where containers are executed in user space. These tools do not\nrequire any privileges and constitute the udocker tools and libraries for\nengines that is downloaded and installed by udocker itself.\n\nRedistribution, commercial use and code changes must regard all licenses\nshipped with udocker. For more information see\n[section 6 External tools and libraries](#6-external-tools-and-libraries).\n\n## 1. Dependencies\n\nThe udocker dependencies are minimal and should be supported by most Linux installations.\nudocker requires:\n\n* Python 3 or alternatively Python >= 2.7\n* pycurl or alternatively the curl command\n* python hashlib or alternatively the openssl command\n* tar\n* find\n* chmod\n* chgrp\n* ldconfig (only used by the Fn execution modes)\n\n## 2. Installation\n\n### 2.1. Install from a released version\n\nDownload a release tarball from <https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/releases>:\n\n```bash\nwget https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/releases/download/1.3.17/udocker-1.3.17.tar.gz\ntar zxvf udocker-1.3.17.tar.gz\nexport PATH=`pwd`/udocker-1.3.17/udocker:$PATH\n```\n\nAlternatively use `curl` instead of `wget` as follows:\n\n```bash\ncurl -L https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/releases/download/1.3.17/udocker-1.3.17.tar.gz \\\n  > udocker-1.3.17.tar.gz\ntar zxvf udocker-1.3.17.tar.gz\nexport PATH=`pwd`/udocker-1.3.17/udocker:$PATH\n```\n\nudocker executes containers using external tools and libraries that\nare enhanced and packaged for use with udocker. For more information see\n[section 6 External tools and libraries](#6-external-tools-and-libraries).\nTherefore to complete the installation invoke `udocker install` to download\nand install the required tools and libraries.\n\n```bash\nudocker install\n```\n\n### 2.2. Install from the GitHub repositories\n\nTo install the latest stable code from the github `master` branch:\n\n```bash\ngit clone --depth=1 https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker.git\n(cd udocker/udocker; ln -s maincmd.py udocker)\nexport PATH=`pwd`/udocker/udocker:$PATH\n```\n\nAlternatively, install the latest development code from the github `dev-v1.4` branch:\n\n```bash\ngit clone -b dev-v1.4 --depth=1 https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker.git\n(cd udocker/udocker; ln -s maincmd.py udocker)\nexport PATH=`pwd`/udocker/udocker:$PATH\n```\n\nAlternatively, install the latest development code from the github `devel3` branch:\n\n```bash\ngit clone -b devel3 --depth=1 https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker.git\n(cd udocker/udocker; ln -s maincmd.py udocker)\nexport PATH=`pwd`/udocker/udocker:$PATH\n```\n\nudocker executes containers using external tools and libraries that\nare enhanced and packaged for use with udocker. For more information see\n[section 6 External tools and libraries](#6-external-tools-and-libraries).\nTherefore to complete the installation invoke `udocker install` to download\nand install the required tools and libraries.\n\n```bash\nudocker install\n```\n\n### 2.3. Install from PyPI using pip\n\nFor installation with pip it is advisable to setup a Python3 virtual environment\nbefore proceeding, see\n[Creating a virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment).\n\n```bash\npython3 -m venv udockervenv\nsource udockervenv/bin/activate\npip install udocker\n```\n\nThe udocker command will be `udockervenv/bin/udocker`.\n\nudocker executes containers using external tools and libraries that\nare enhanced and packaged for use with udocker. For more information see\n[section 6 External tools and libraries](#6-external-tools-and-libraries).\nTherefore to complete the installation invoke `udocker install` to download\nand install the required tools and libraries.\n\n```bash\nudocker install\n```\n\n### 2.4. Install without outbound network access\n\nWhen the installation is attempted without having outbound network connectivity,\nthe installation of the binary tools and libraries with `udocker install` will\nfail the download step. The solution is to fetch the the tarball in advance\nand then install the tools and libraries directly from the tarball file.\n\nThe tarballs containing the tools and libraries are available at <https://github.com/jorge-lip/udocker-builds>.\n\nFirst, download a tarball file using:\n\n```bash\ncurl -L https://github.com/jorge-lip/udocker-builds/raw/master/tarballs/udocker-englib-1.2.8.tar.gz > udocker-englib-1.2.8.tar.gz\n```\n\nSecond, transfer the udocker code plus the tarball containing the tools and\nlibraries to the target destination host.\n\nFinally perform the `udocker install` step using the transferred tarball file.\n\n```bash\nexport UDOCKER_TARBALL=udocker-englib-1.2.8.tar.gz\nudocker install\n```\n\nThe environment variable `UDOCKER_TARBALL` can also point to an URL to fetch\nthe tarball from a specific or alternate location. To fetch from multiple\npossible locations for redundancy the environment variable `UDOCKER_TARBALL`\ncan contain multiple URLs separated by a blank.\n\n```bash\nexport UDOCKER_TARBALL=\"https://... https://... http://...\"\nudocker install\n```\n\n### 2.5. Force the re-installation of the tools and libraries\n\nTo force download and re-installation of the udocker tools and libraries.\nInvoke `udocker install` with the flag `--force`:\n\n```bash\nudocker install --force\n```\n\n## 3. Configuration\n\nThe configuration of udocker has the following hierarchy:\n\n1. The default configuration options are set in the `conf` dictionary in the `Config` class.\n2. If a configuration file is present ([section 4. Configuration files](#4-configuration-files)),\n   it will override 1.\n3. If environment variables are set ([section 5. Environment variables](#5-environment-variables)),\n   they will override 2.\n4. The presence of general udocker command line options, will override 3.\n\n### 3.1. Directories\n\nWith the default configuration, udocker creates files and subdirectories under\n`$HOME/.udocker` these are:\n\n* `doc`: documentation and licenses.\n* `bin`: executables to support the execution engines.\n* `lib`: libraries, namely the fakechroot libraries to support the **F** execution mode.\n* `repos`: container image repositories.\n* `layers`: the layers and metadata for the container images.\n* `containers`: created containers.\n* `keystore.github`: authentication to access repositories (created on demand).\n\nBoth installed files, as well as the containers to be downloaded or created\nwith udocker, will be installed by default under `$HOME/.udocker`.\n\nA default configuration file is available at\n[udocker.conf](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/blob/master/etc/udocker.conf)\nit can be copied to your udocker directory as `$HOME/.udocker/udocker.conf` and\ncustomized.\n\n## 4. Configuration files\n\nThe configuration files allow overriding of the udocker `Config` class\n`conf` dictionary. Example of the `udocker.conf` syntax:\n\n```ini\ndockerio_registry_url = \"https://myregistry.mydomain:5000\"\nhttp_insecure = True\nverbose_level = 5\n```\n\nudocker loads the following configuration files if they are present:\n\n1. `/etc/udocker.conf`\n2. `$HOME/.udocker/udocker.conf`: overrides the options set in 1.\n3. `$UDOCKER_DIR/udocker.conf` (if different from the above): overrides the options set in 2.\n4. Configuration file set with the general CLI option `--config=`: overrides the options set in 3.\n\n## 5. Environment variables\n\nThe following environment variables can be used to customize the installation.\nThe location of the udocker directories can be changed via the environment\nvariables:\n\n* `UDOCKER_DIR`: root directory of udocker usually $HOME/.udocker\n* `UDOCKER_BIN`: location of udocker related executables\n* `UDOCKER_LIB`: location of udocker related libraries\n* `UDOCKER_DOC`: location of documentation and licenses\n* `UDOCKER_REPOS` images metadata and links to layers\n* `UDOCKER_LAYERS`: the common location for image layers data\n* `UDOCKER_CONTAINERS`: location of container directory trees (not images)\n* `UDOCKER_TMP`: location of temporary directory\n* `UDOCKER_KEYSTORE`: location of keystore for login/logout credentials\n* `UDOCKER_TARBALL`: location of installation tarball (file of URL)\n* `UDOCKER_NOSYSCONF`: do not read system wide config files in /etc\n\nThe Docker index and registry can be overridden via the environment variables.\n\n* `UDOCKER_INDEX=https://...`\n* `UDOCKER_REGISTRY=https://...`\n\nThe verbosity level of udocker can be enforced. Removing banners and most\nmessages can be achieved by executing with `UDOCKER_LOGLEVEL=2`.\n\n* `UDOCKER_LOGLEVEL`: set verbosity level from 0 to 5 (MIN to MAX verbosity)\n\nForcing the use of a given curl executable instead of pycurl can be\nspecified with:\n\n* `UDOCKER_USE_CURL_EXECUTABLE`: pathname to the location of curl executable\n\nThe fakechroot execution modes (Fn modes), the translation of symbolic links\nto the actual links can be controlled by the environment variable\n`UDOCKER_FAKECHROOT_EXPAND_SYMLINKS`. The default value is\n`none` which will select automatically the mode to be used, `false` if mounts are\nnot performed or if the mount points pathname for the host and container\nare equal (e.g `-v /home:/home`), `true` otherwise (e.g `-v /data:/home`).\n\n* `UDOCKER_FAKECHROOT_EXPAND_SYMLINKS`: true, false, none\n\nThe location of some executables used by the execution modes can be enforced with\nthe environment variables described below together with the default behavior.\nA value of `UDOCKER` will force the usage of the executables provided by the\nudocker installation.\n\nA full pathname can be used to force selection of a specific executable (or library)\nfrom the host or from the udocker installation.\n\n* `UDOCKER_USE_PROOT_EXECUTABLE`: path to proot, default is proot from udocker.\n* `UDOCKER_USE_RUNC_EXECUTABLE`: path to runc, default is search the host and\n  if not found use runc from udocker.\n* `UDOCKER_USE_SINGULARITY_EXECUTABLE`: path to singularity, default is search\n  the host.\n* `UDOCKER_FAKECHROOT_SO`: path to a fakechroot library, default is search\n  in udocker under `$HOME/.udocker/lib`.\n* `UDOCKER_DEFAULT_EXECUTION_MODE`: default execution mode can be P1, P2, F1,\n  S1, R1, R2 or R3.\n\nSeveral executables and libraries are shipped with udocker. For instance\nthe executable for the Rn modes can be selected to be either `runc` or\n`crun`. This can be accomplished by setting `UDOCKER_USE_RUNC_EXECUTABLE`\nto the path of the desired executable. If `runsc` is available in the\nhost it can also be selected in this manner.\n\n```\n# Forcing the use of crun instead of runc\nexport UDOCKER_USE_RUNC_EXECUTABLE=$HOME/.udocker/bin/crun-x86_64\nexport UDOCKER_DEFAULT_EXECUTION_MODE=R1\nudocker run <mycontainerid>\n```\n\n## 6. External tools and libraries\n\n### 6.1. Source code repositories\n\nudocker uses external tools and libraries to execute the created containers.\nThe source code for the udocker tools and libraries is taken from several repositories.\nThe **F** modes need heavily modified Fakechroot libraries and also a modified Patchelf\nboth specifically improved to work with udocker. The Fakechroot for musl is a port\nof the Fakechroot library for the musl libc performed by the udocker development team.\nThe **P** modes need a modified PRoot that includes fixes and enhancements to work with\nudocker. The **R** modes use the original runc and crun software with small changes for\nstatic compilation. The following table highlights the repositories used by udocker\ncontaining the modified source code and the original repositories.\n\n| Mode  | Engine           | Repository used by udocker                                 | Original repository\n|-------|:-----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------\n| **P** | PRoot            | <https://github.com/jorge-lip/proot-udocker>               | <https://github.com/proot-me/proot>\n| **F** | Fakechroot glibc | <https://github.com/jorge-lip/libfakechroot-glibc-udocker> | <https://github.com/dex4er/fakechroot>\n| **F** | Fakechroot musl  | <https://github.com/jorge-lip/libfakechroot-musl-udocker>  | <https://github.com/dex4er/fakechroot>\n| **F** | Patchelf         | <https://github.com/jorge-lip/patchelf-udocker>            | <https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf>\n| **R** | runc             | THE ORIGINAL REPOSITORY IS USED                            | <https://github.com/opencontainers/runc>\n| **R** | crun             | THE ORIGINAL REPOSITORY IS USED                            | <https://github.com/containers/crun>\n\n### 6.2. Software Licenses\n\nRedistribution, commercial use and code changes must regard all licenses shipped with udocker.\nThese include the [udocker license](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/blob/master/LICENSE)\nand the individual licenses of the external tools and libraries packaged for use with udocker.\n\n| Mode  | Engine           | License\n|-------|:-----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| **P** | PRoot            | [GPL v2](https://github.com/jorge-lip/proot-udocker/blob/master/COPYING)\n| **F** | Fakechroot glibc | [LGPL v2.1](https://github.com/jorge-lip/libfakechroot-glibc-udocker/blob/master/LICENSE)\n| **F** | Fakechroot musl  | [LGPL v2.1](https://github.com/jorge-lip/libfakechroot-musl-udocker/blob/master/LICENSE)\n| **F** | Patchelf         | [GPL v3](https://github.com/jorge-lip/patchelf-udocker/blob/master/COPYING)\n| **R** | runc             | [Apache v2.0](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/master/LICENSE)\n| **R** | crun             | [GPL v2](https://github.com/containers/crun/blob/master/COPYING)\n\n### 6.3. Binaries\n\nAs mentioned in the previous sections the compiled binaries can be installed\nwith `udocker install`. Optionally they can be downloaded from the repository\ncontaining the binary builds at: <https://github.com/jorge-lip/udocker-builds>\n\nThe executables are provided statically compiled for use across systems.\nThe shared libraries that support the **F** modes need to match the libc\nwithin the container and are provided for several Linux distributions.\nSee `$HOME/.udocker/lib` for the supported distributions and corresponding\nversions. The tools are also delivered for several architectures.\n\n| Mode  | Supported architecture                       |\n|-------|:---------------------------------------------|\n| **P** | x86_64, i386, aarch64 and arm                |\n| **F** | x86_64, aarch64, ppc64le                     |\n| **R** | x86_64  aarch64                              |\n| **S** | uses the binaries present in the host system |\n\n### 6.3. Compiling\n\nudocker already provides executables and libraries for the engines. These\nare statically compiled to be used across different Linux distributions.\nIn some cases these executables may not work and may require recompilation.\nUse the repositories in section 6.2 if you which to compile the executables\nor libraries. Notice that the git repositories that are specific of udocker\nhave branches or tags like `UDOCKER-x` where `x` is a number. Use the branch\nor tag with the highest number.\n\nA notable case are the fakechroot libraries used in the Fn modes that need\nto match the libc in the container. This means that a libfakechroot.so must\nbe produced for each different distribution release and intended architecture.\nTwo implementations of the `libc` are supported `glibc` and `musl`, choose\nthe one that matches the distribution inside the container. Once compiled the\nselection of the library can be forced by setting the environment variable\n`UDOCKER_FAKECHROOT_SO`.\n\n```\nudocker setup --execmode=F3 <mycontainerid>\nUDOCKER_FAKECHROOT_SO=$HOME/mylibfakechroot.so  udocker run <mycontainerid>\n```\n\nThe latest binary tarball can be produced from the source code using:\n\n```bash\ngit clone -b devel3 https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker\ncd udocker/utils\n./build_tarball.sh\n```\n\n## 7. Central installation\n\nudocker can be installed and made available system wide from a central location\nsuch as a shared read-only directory tree or file-system. The following guidelines\nshould be followed when installing udocker in a central shared location or in a\nread only file system.\n\n### 7.1. Install executables and libraries centrally\n\nThe executables and libraries can be installed with any of the methods described\nin section 2 of this manual. The directory tree should contain the following\nsubdirectories: `bin`,  `containers`,  `layers`,  `lib`,  `repos`. For the\nbinaries and libraries the only directories required are `bin` and `lib`.\n\nThe udocker tool should be installed as shown in section 2.1:\n\n```bash\ncd /sw\nwget https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/releases/download/1.3.17/udocker-1.3.17.tar.gz\ntar zxvf udocker-1.3.17.tar.gz\n```\n\nDirecting users to the central udocker installation can be done using the\nenvironment variables described in section 5, or through the configuration files\ndescribed in section 6. The recommended approach is to set environment\nvariables at the user level as in the example where the assumed central location\nwill be under `/sw/udocker`:\n\n```bash\nexport UDOCKER_BIN=/sw/udocker/bin\nexport UDOCKER_LIB=/sw/udocker/lib\nexport PATH=$PATH:$UDOCKER_BIN:/sw/udocker\n```\n\nNote that the command `udocker` will be in `/sw/udocker` with all the python\ndirectory structure, while `/sw/udocker/bin` has all execution engines.\n\nMake sure that the file protections are adequate namely that the files are\nnot modifiable by others.\n\n### 7.2. Images and layers in central installations\n\nThe repository of pulled images can also be placed in a different location\nthan the user home directory `$HOME/.udocker`. Notice that if the target\nlocation is not writable then the users will be unable to pull new images,\nwhich may be fine if these images are managed centrally by someone else.\nMake sure that the file protections are adequate to the intended purpose.\n\nFrom the images in the common location the users can then create containers\nwhose content will be placed in the user home directory under `$HOME/.udocker`.\nThis can be accomplished by redirecting the directories `layers` and  `repos`\nto a common location. The users will need to set the following environment\nvariables. Therefore assuming that the common location will be `/sw/udocker`:\n\n```bash\nexport UDOCKER_REPOS=/sw/udocker/repos\nexport UDOCKER_LAYERS=/sw/udocker/layers\n```\n\n### 7.3. Containers in central installations\n\nIf a container is extracted to the common location, it is possible to\npoint udocker to execute the container from that location. Making\nudocker pointing at different `containers` directory such as for example\n`/sw/udocker/containers` can be accomplished with:\n\n```bash\nexport UDOCKER_CONTAINERS=/sw/udocker/containers\n```\n\nAssuming that the container is to be created under `/sw/udocker/containers`\nit can be extracted with:\n\n```bash\nexport UDOCKER_CONTAINERS=/sw/udocker/containers\nudocker --allow-root pull  centos:centos7\nudocker --allow-root create  --name=myContainerId  centos:centos7\nudocker --allow-root run  -v /tmp myContainerId\n```\n\nNotice the `--allow-root` should only be used when running\nfrom the root user. However depending on the execution mode and several other\nfactors the limitations described in the next sections apply.\n\n#### 7.3.1. Selection of execution mode for central installations\n\nThe selection of the execution mode requires writing in the `containers`\ndirectory, therefore if the container is in a read-only location the\nexecution mode cannot be changed. If a container is to be executed in a mode\nother than the default then this must be set in advance. This must be done\nby someone with write access. A table summarizing the execution modes\nand their implications:\n\n|Mode| Engine      | Execution from readonly location\n|----|:------------|:------------------------------------------\n| P1 | PRoot       | OK\n| P2 | PRoot       | OK\n| F1 | Fakechroot  | OK\n| F2 | Fakechroot  | OK\n| F3 | Fakechroot  | OK see restrictions in section 7.3.1.2.\n| F4 | Fakechroot  | NOT SUPPORTED REQUIRES WRITE ACCESS\n| R1 | runc / crun | OK requires udocker version above v1.1.7\n| R2 | runc / crun | OK see restrictions in section 7.3.1.3.\n| R3 | runc / crun | OK see restrictions in section 7.3.1.3.\n| S1 | Singularity | OK\n\nChanging the execution mode can be accomplished with the following udocker\ncommand where `<MODE>` is one of the supported modes in column one.\n\n```bash\nudocker --allow-root setup --execmode=<MODE> myContainerId\n```\n\nNotice the `--allow-root` should only be used when running\nfrom the root user.\n\nIf the same container is to be provided for execution using more\nthan one execution mode (e.g. to be executed with P1 and F3), then\nmake copies of the initial container and setup each one of them with\nthe intended mode. The command `udocker clone` can be used to create\ncopies of existing containers.\n\n##### 7.3.1.1. Mode F4 is not supported\n\nThe mode F4 is not suitable for readonly containers as it is meant to\nsupport the dynamic creation of new executables and libraries inside of\nthe container, which cannot happen if the container is readonly. Use the\nmode F3 instead of F4.\n\n##### 7.3.1.2. Mode F3 restrictions\n\nThe F3 mode (and also F4) perform changes to the container executables\nand libraries, in particular they change the pathnames in ELF headers\nmaking them pointing at the container location. This means that the\npathname to the container must be always the same across all the\nhosts that may share the common location. Therefore if the original\nlocation pathname is `/sw/udocker/containers` then all hosts must\nalso mount it at the same exact path `/sw/udocker/containers`.\n\n##### 7.3.1.3. Modes R1, R2 and R3 general restrictions\n\nThese modes make use of runc or crun and require that user namespaces\nare enabled in the kernel. Older distributions may either not have\nsupport for namespaces (e.g. CentOS 6) or may have the support for\nuser namespaces disabled at the system level (e.g. CentOS 7). More\nrecent releases of Linux distributions do have support for user\nnamespaces (e.g. CentOS 8 and CentOS 9).\n\nFor Centos 7 there are steps that system administrators may perform\nto enable user namespaces, such as:\n\n```bash\nsudo echo \"user.max_user_namespaces=10000\" >> /etc/sysctl.conf\n```\n\n##### 7.3.1.4. Modes R2 and R3 specific restrictions\n\nCentral installation from readonly location using any of the R modes\nrequires udocker above v1.1.7.\nThese modes require the creation of a mount point inside the container\nthat is transparently created when the container is first executed,\ntherefore (as recommended for all other modes) the container\nmust be executed once by someone with write access prior to making it\navailable to the users. Furthermore these execution modes are nested\nthey use P1 or P2 inside the R engine, the Pn modes require a tmp\ndirectory that is writable. Therefore it is recommended to mount the\nhost `/tmp` in the container `/tmp` like this:\n\n```bash\nudocker --allow-root run  -v /tmp myContainerId\n```\n\nOr alternatively:\n\n```bash\nexport PROOT_TMP_DIR=/<path-to-host-writable-directory>\nudocker --allow-root run  -v /<path-to-host-writable-directory>  myContainerId\n```\n\nNotice the `--allow-root` should only be used when running from the root user.\n\n#### 7.3.2. Mount directories and files in central installations\n\nMaking host files and directories visible inside the container requires\ncreating the corresponding mount points. The creation of mount-points\nrequires write access to the container. Therefore if a container is in\na read-only location these files and directories must be created in\nadvance.\n\nNotice that some default mount points are required and automatically\ncreated by udocker itself, therefore the container should be executed\nby the administrator to ensure that the required files and directories\nare created. Furthermore if additional mount points are required to\naccess data or other user files from the host, such mount points\nmust also be created by the administrator by executing the container\nwith the adequate volume pathnames. The example shows how to setup\nthe default mount points and in addition create a new mount point\nnamed `/data`.\n\n```bash\nudocker --allow-root run -v /home:/data  myContainerId\n```\n\nNotice the `--allow-root` should only be used when running\nfrom the root user.\n\nNotice that once `/data` is setup the end users can mount other\ndirectories in `/data` at runtime, meaning that users are not\nrestricted to mount only the `/home` directory as the mapping\nis defined at run time.\n\n#### 7.3.3. Protection of container files and directories\n\nFor the container to be executed by other users the files and\ndirectories within the container must be readable. When udocker\nis installed in the user home directory all files belong to\nthe user and are therefore readable by him. If a common location\nis shared by several users the file protections will likely\nneed to be adjusted. Consider carefully your security policies\nand requirements when changing the file protections.\n\nThe following example assumes making all files readable to\nanyone and making all files (and directories) that have the\nexecutable bit to be also *executable* by anyone.\n\n```bash\nexport mycdir=$(udocker --allow-root inspect -p myContainerId)\nchmod -R uog+r $mycdir\nfind $mycdir -executable -exec chmod oug+x {} \\;\n```\n\nNotice the `--allow-root` should only be used when running\nfrom the root user.\n\n### 7.4. Using a common directory for executables and containers\n\nIf the common directory is used both for executables and containers\nthen the following environment variables can be used:\n\n```bash\nexport UDOCKER_DIR=/sw/udocker\nexport PATH=$PATH:$UDOCKER_DIR:$UDOCKER_DIR/bin\n```\n\n## 8. Uninstall\n\nudocker does not provide an uninstall command. udocker can be uninstalled\nby simply removing the created files and directories. The recommended\napproach is as follows:\n\n1. Fix permissions for all created containers\n   `for id in $(udocker ps | cut -f1 -d\" \" | grep -v CONTAINER); do udocker setup --fixperm $id; done`\n2. Remove all created containers\n   `for id in $(udocker ps | cut -f1 -d\" \" | grep -v CONTAINER); do udocker rm -f $id; done`\n3. Remove the *udocker directory tree* usually under `$HOME/.udocker`\n   `cd $HOME ; rm -Rf .udocker`\n4. Remove the udocker Python code\n\nThe *udocker directory tree* contains the external executables, libraries,\ndocumentation, container images and container file system trees. By removing\nit all created containers will be also removed. Changing the file permissions\nmight be required prior to deletion especially for the container file system\ntrees in the `containers` subdirectory.\n\n## 9. Quality assurance\n\nThe udocker software quality assurance follows the Common Software\nQuality Assurance Baseline Criteria for Research Projects\nDOI: <http://hdl.handle.net/10261/160086.> available at\n<https://indigo-dc.github.io/sqa-baseline/>.\n\nudocker uses the Jenkins Pipeline Library\n<https://github.com/indigo-dc/jenkins-pipeline-library>\nto implement Jenkins CI/CD pipelines for quality assurance.\n\n### 9.1. Functional and integration tests\n\nHigh level functional and integration tests used for quality assurance are available\nin <https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/tree/master/utils>.\nThese tests are also suitable to be executed by end-users to verify the installation.\nAfter cloning the udocker repository with `git` the `bash` scripts\ncan be executed using:\n\n```bash\ncd utils\n./udocker_test.sh\n./udocker_test-run.sh\n```\n\nIf the `.udocker` directory already exists these tests will not execute as they require\na clean environment. In this case proceed as follows:\n\n1. rename the directory `$HOME/.udocker`, as in `mv $HOME/.udocker $HOME/.udocker.ORIG`\n2. execute the tests\n3. remove the `$HOME/.udocker` created by the tests\n4. restore the original `.udocker` directory as in `mv $HOME/.udocker.ORIG $HOME/.udocker`\n\n### 9.2. Unit and security tests\n\nThe unit tests used in the software quality assurance pipelines are available at\n<https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/tree/master/tests/unit>.\nThe tests can be executed after creating a virtualenv and installing the development\nrequirements in [requirements-dev.txt](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/blob/master/requirements-dev.txt)\nThese tests are meant to be executed by the automated quality assurance pipelines.\n\n```bash\nvirtualenv -p python3 ud3\nsource ud3/bin/activate\ngit clone https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker.git\ncd udocker\npip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n```\n\nThe unit tests coverage can be executed using:\n\n```bash\nnosetests -v --with-coverage --cover-package=udocker tests/unit\n```\n\nOther tests configured in `tox.ini`, can be executed as well, such as linting\n(code style checking) and static security tests:\n\n```bash\npylint --rcfile=pylintrc --disable=R,C udocker\nbandit -r udocker -f html -o bandit.html\n```\n",

                "value": "Some examples of usage:\n\nSearch container images in dockerhub and listing tags.\n\n```bash\nudocker search  fedora\nudocker search  ubuntu\nudocker search  debian\n\nudocker search --list-tags ubuntu\n```\n\nPull from dockerhub and list the pulled images.\n\n```bash\nudocker pull   fedora:39\nudocker pull   busybox\nudocker pull   iscampos/openqcd\nudocker images\n```\n\nPull from a registry other than dockerhub.\n\n```bash\nudocker search  quay.io/bio\nudocker search  --list-tags  quay.io/biocontainers/scikit-bio\nudocker pull    quay.io/biocontainers/scikit-bio:0.2.3--np112py35_0\nudocker images\n```\n\nPull a different architecture such as arm64 instead of amd64.\n\n```bash\nudocker manifest inspect centos/centos8\nudocker pull --platform=linux/arm64 centos/centos8\nudocker tag centos/centos8  mycentos/centos8:arm64\n```\n\nCreate a container from a pulled image, assign a name to the created\ncontainer and run it. A created container can be run multiple times\nuntil it is explicitly removed. Files modified or added to the container\nremain available across executions until the container is removed.\n\n```bash\nudocker create --name=myfed  fedora:29\nudocker run  myfed  cat /etc/redhat-release\n```\n\nThe three steps of pulling, creating and running can be also achieved\nin a single command, however this will be much slower for multiple\ninvocations of the same container, as a new container will be created\nfor each invocation. This approach will also consume more storage space.\nThe following example creates a new container for each invocation.\n\n```bash\nudocker run  fedora:29  cat /etc/redhat-release\n```\n\nExecute mounting the host /home/u457 into the container directory /home/cuser.\nNotice that you can \"mount\" any host directory inside the container.\nDepending on the execution mode the \"mount\" is implemented differently and\nmay have restrictions.\n\n```bash\nudocker run -v /home/u457:/home/cuser -w /home/user myfed  /bin/bash\nudocker run -v /var -v /proc -v /sys -v /tmp  myfed  /bin/bash\n```\n\nPlace a script in your host /tmp and execute it in the container. Notice\nthat the behavior of `--entrypoint` changed from the previous versions\nfor better compatibility with docker.\n\n```bash\nudocker run  -v /tmp  --entrypoint=\"\" myfed  /bin/bash -c 'cd /tmp; ./myscript.sh'\n\nudocker run  -v /tmp  --entrypoint=/bin/bash  myfed  -c 'cd /tmp; ./myscript.sh'\n```\n\nExecute mounting the host /var, /proc, /sys and /tmp in the same container\ndirectories. Notice that the content of these container directories will\nbe obfuscated by the host files.\n\n```bash\nudocker run -v /var -v /proc -v /sys -v /tmp  myfed  /bin/bash\n```\n\nInstall software inside the container.\n\n```bash\nudocker run  --user=root myfed  yum install -y firefox pulseaudio gnash-plugin\n```\n\nRun as some user. The usernames should exist in the container.\n\n```bash\nudocker run --user 1000:1001  myfed  /bin/id\nudocker run --user root   myfed  /bin/id\nudocker run --user jorge  myfed  /bin/id\n```\n\nRunning Firefox.\n\n```bash\nudocker run --bindhome --hostauth --hostenv \\\n   -v /sys -v /proc -v /var/run -v /dev --user=jorge --dri myfed  firefox\n```\n\nChange execution engine mode from PRoot to Fakechroot and run.\n\n```bash\nudocker setup  --execmode=F3  myfed\n\nudocker run --bindhome --hostauth --hostenv \\\n   -v /sys -v /proc -v /var/run -v /dev --user=jorge --dri myfed  firefox\n```\n\nChange execution engine mode to accelerated PRoot.\n\n```bash\nudocker setup  --execmode=P1  myfed\n```\n\nChange execution engine to runc.\n\n```bash\nudocker setup  --execmode=R1  myfed\n```\n\nChange execution engine to Singularity. Requires the availability of\nSingularity in the host system.\n\n```bash\n./udocker setup  --execmode=S1  myfed\n```\n\nInstall software running as root emulation in Singularity:\n\n```bash\nudocker setup  --execmode=S1  myfed\nudocker run  --user=root myfed  yum install -y firefox pulseaudio gnash-plugin\n```\n\nChange execution to enable nvidia ready applications. Requires that\nthe nvidia drivers are installed in the host system.\n\n```bash\nudocker setup  --nvidia  mytensorflow\n```\n",
