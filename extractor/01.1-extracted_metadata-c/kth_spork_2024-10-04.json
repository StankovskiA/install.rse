                "description": "# Spork v0.3.0 release notes\r\n\r\nThis is an exciting release with tons of new features, stability fixes and general tuning made to Spork. It now actually works pretty well!\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* 4ef433e Add line-based fallback and --exit-on-error option, fix #120\r\n    - By default, Spork will now fall back on a line-based merge if it encounters a critical error when merging structurally. Such cases are rare, but they do occur, especially in the presence of complicated move conflicts. `--exit-on-error` disables the line-based fallback, which is useful for research work but not recommended otherwise.\r\n* 14f733b Make Spork comply with git merge-file, fix #113\r\n    - Now returns the amount of conflicts. Roughly.\r\n* 0643d74 Dynamically get version from pom.properties, fix #118\r\n    - `--version` now actually shows the version number!\r\n* ca05291 Remove the compare command, fix #117\r\n    - The `compare` command no longer served a purpose. Merging is now invoked with just `spork`, as opposed to `spork merge`.\r\n* 79517d7 Add --logging option that enables logging, fix #104\r\n   - The `--logging` option enables logging, which is otherwise disabled. It lets you know roughly what Spork is doing!\r\n* fee080a Improve indentation size guessing: choose 1, 2 or 4 #100\r\n* 6f11494 fee080a Guess indentation of source files, fix #100\r\n    - Will guess the indentation level and type (tabs or spaces) of the source files and apply that to the output file.\r\n* 4d5ffb6 Use original source for methods and fields (#97)\r\n    - Spork will now reuse the original source code for methods and fields that have not been merged internally. This dramatically improves the formatting accuracy of Spork.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n* 56491be Add leaf node PCS child lists, fix #116 \r\n* 3b035ab Avoid using original source for multi-declarations, fix #111 \r\n* c95b20e Fix non-deterministic move conflict detection, fix #101\r\n* 1934a10 Fix incorrect indentation bug when writing raw source\r\n* f54dced Fix off-by-one bugs in SourceExtractor\r\n* 590ddb7 Extract source code fragments from strings instead of bytes, fix #99\r\n\r\n### Refactorings\r\n* 926ece3 Make logging lazy, fix #103\r\n* 25ddd77 Make printer compatible with Spoon 8.2.x #106\r\n* 004630d Make PCS interpreter compatible with Spoon 8.2.x #206\r\n* 6ed9c2c Refactor project layout\r\n* 0d947fa Build intermediate tree from change set #96",

It's a very simple thing to configure Spork as a merge driver for Java\nfiles, all you need is to add a couple of lines to a couple of configuration files. First, let's create a\n`.gitattributes` file and specify to use Spork as a merge driver for Java files. Put the following content in your\n`.gitattributes` file (you may all ready have one, check your home directory):\n```\n*.java merge=spork\n```\n`spork` doesn't mean anything to Git yet, we need to actually define the merge driver called `spork`. We do that in the\n`.gitconfig` file, typically located in your home directory. You should put the following content into it:\n```\n[core]\n\tattributesfile = /path/to/.gitattributes\n\n[merge \"spork\"]\n    name = spork\n    driver = java -jar /path/to/spork.jar merge --git-mode %A %O %B -o %A\n```\n \nThen replace `/path/to/.gitattributes` with the absolute path to the `.gitattributes` file you edited/created first,\nand replace `/path/to/spork.jar` with the absolute path to the Spork jar-file. With that done, Spork will be used\nas the merge driver for Java files! \n> **Important:** The `--git-mode` option is required to use Spork as a Git merge driver. If you find that Spork always\n> reverts to line-based merge, then that option is probably missing in the `driver` option that invokes Spork.\n \n",
