Some prominent examples of hyperparameters include l1 vs. l2 loss\nfunction in support vector machines, the maximum depth of a decision tree,\nand the number of layers/neurons in deep neural networks. \nAfter stopping the search algorithm (a default of 4 hours), we use clustering\nalgorithms to partition the hyperparameter inputs generated from the search based on fairness and accuracy values. Given two groups of inputs with low and high biases and similar accuracy, we infer CART decision trees that show what hyperparameters are common inside a cluster and what hyperparameters distinguish low fairness configurations from the high fairness one. \n \n",

The [`black-box fuzzer`](./main_mutation.py) interacts with the\n[`logistic regression algorithm`](subjects/LogisticRegression.py). The hyperparameter variables and their domains are specified\nas an XML file, see [`XML file for Logistic Regression`](subjects/LogisticRegression_Params.XML). The datasets are in [`datasets folder`](subjects/datasets/). For this example, we use [`census dataset`](subjects/datasets/census). \n\nWe first generate test cases. Throughout the paper, we run\nthe test-case generation procedure for 4, except for RQ4.\nHere, we run the black-box fuzzer for 10 minutes:\n```\npython3 main_mutation.py --dataset=census --algorithm=LogisticRegression --sensitive_index=8 --output=LogisticRegression_census_sex.csv --time_out=600\n```\nwhere the column with index 8 is corresponds to `race` attribute of each sample individual. After $10$ minutes, the process\nends and shows the test case filename, which is\na CSV file. \nWe can issue `vi` command to explore the csv\nfile (`Dataset/LogisticRegression_census_sex.csv`) where each row is a configuration of hyperparameter\nvalues, their corresponding accuracy (score), AOD fairness metric,\nEOD metric (TPR), etc. \n\nOne can replace `main_mutation.py` with\n`main_random.py` to run independently random algorithm\nand with `main_coverage.py` to run graybox fuzzing algorithm.\nSimilarly, dataset and algorithms can be replaced to\nperform experiments on other learning algorithms as well\nas datasets (full lists are available in the paper\nas well as in [`all scripts`](scripts.sh). Next,\nwe run clustering and decision tree algorithm:\n```\npython3 clustering_DT.py --test_case=LogisticRegression_census_sex.csv --clusters 2\n```\nwhere `LogisticRegression_census_sex.csv` is the name of test-case outcome from the \nlast step and `clusters` show the number of cluster. This\nwill produce clustering and decision tree models that can find\ninside `Results` folders (two png files: one is for clustering\nresult and another is for decision tree).\n",
