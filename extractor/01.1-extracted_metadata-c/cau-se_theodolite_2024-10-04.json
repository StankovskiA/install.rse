Even arbitrary complex mathematical expressions with load and resources as variables are possible.\r\n* A new [generic patcher](https://www.theodolite.rocks/api-reference/patchers.html) allows to patch arbitrary Kubernetes resources (including CRDs) by specifying the JSON path ob the field to be patched.\r\n* The configuration and implementations of the [Theodolite stream processing benchmarks](https://www.theodolite.rocks/theodolite-benchmarks/) are further aligned to allow for a better comparison of different frameworks.\r\n* The Theodolite benchmark definitions for the stream processing benchmarks are extended to include options for vertical scaling and provide a *dropped records* SLO. They also define topics now using Strimzi.\r\n* Configurability of the Strimzi Kafka deployment is improved.",

This is more natural as typically the benchmark designer knows about relevant metrics and SLOs. However, benchmarkers can still override SLO configurations such as thresholds.\r\n* Theodolite adds full supports for the [*load capacity metric*](https://www.theodolite.rocks/concepts/metrics.html). Benchmarkers can choose whether they would like to use the already existing *resource demand* metric or the new *load capacity* metric.\r\n* [Delete Actions](https://www.theodolite.rocks/creating-a-benchmark.html#delete-actions) are a second type of before/after actions, which, as their name suggests, delete Kubernetes resources when being executed.\r\n* The execution CRD definition for configuring the search strategy has changed.\r\n* Installation of the Confluent Helm chart is now disabled per default and will be completely removed in a future release.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the Theodolite's CRDs have changed. When upgrading from a previous version, a simple `helm upgrade` will not be sufficient. Instead you should [uninstall](https://www.theodolite.rocks/installation.html#uninstall-theodolite) and [re-install Theodolite](https://www.theodolite.rocks/installation.html). As our CRDs full name has also changed, you might need to additionally run `kubectl delete crd executions.theodolite.com; kubectl delete crd benchmarks.theodolite.com`, before re-installing Theodolite.",

This can be disabled.\r\n* A new SLO checker is available for Kafka Streams, which checks whether the amount of dropped records exceeds a certain threshold.\r\n* Kubernetes volumes for benchmark results can be created from Helm.\r\n* The Helm allows to define a nodeSelector for Theodolite.\r\n* We updated some dependencies of our Helm chart.\r\n* **With this release our website and documentation is available via https://www.theodolite.rocks**\r\n\r\nPlease note that the Theodolite CRDs have changed. When upgrading from a previous version, a simple `helm upgrade` will not be sufficient. Instead you should uninstall and re-install Theodolite.",

This release is a huge step toward the first stable version of Theodolite. Features of this release include:\r\n\r\n* Entire rewrite of Theodolite in Kotlin and Quarkus for better interaction with the Kubernetes API\r\n* Optional execution as [Kubernetes Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) for better usability (recommended)\r\n* A data model for defining benchmarks (as [CRD](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) in operator mode) to support arbitrary benchmarks and SUTs apart from the Theodolite benchmarks. This includes:\r\n  * Description of SUTs and LoadGenerators as sets of Kubernetes resources\r\n  * Support for arbitrary load and resources types, according to [our scalability metric](https://doi.org/10.1145/3447545.3451190)\r\n  * Flexible configuration of Kafka topics\r\n  * Benchmark CRs for the Theodolite Kafka Streams and Flink benchmarks are provided\r\n* A data model for describing benchmark executions (again as [CRD](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) in operator mode). This includes:\r\n  * Support for repeating SLO experiments, from which the median lag trend value is then chosen\r\n  * Extension mechanism for custom SLO checkers\r\n  * Support for arbitrary configuration changes of the SUT or load generator to benchmark different SUT configurations etc.\r\n* A Theodolite Helm chart (recommended way for installation)\r\n* Optional usage of a *random scheduler* to mitigate scheduling effects on the benchmark results\r\n* Full support for implementations of the Theodolite benchmarks with Flink (partly already releases with v.0.4.0)\r\n\r\nWe thank @benediktwetzel, @lorenzboguhn, @sehrenstein, @bvonheid and @NicoBiernat for their massive support in designing, implementing, and testing Theodolite v0.5.0.",

                "value": "---\ntitle: Installation\nhas_children: false\nnav_order: 3\n---\n\n# Installing Theodolite\n\nThe easiest option to install Theodolite is using [Helm](https://helm.sh).\nTo install Theodolite with all its dependencies run:\n\n```sh\nhelm repo add theodolite https://www.theodolite.rocks\nhelm repo update\nhelm install theodolite theodolite/theodolite\n```\n\n## Installation Options\n\nAs usual, the installation via Helm can be configured by passing a values YAML file:\n\n```sh\nhelm install theodolite theodolite/theodolite --values <your-config.yaml>\n```\n\nFor this purpose the [default values file](https://github.com/cau-se/theodolite/blob/main/helm/values.yaml) can serve as a template for your custom configuration.\n\n### Minimal setup\n\nFor Kubernetes clusters with limited resources such as on local developer installations, we provide a [minimal values file](https://github.com/cau-se/theodolite/blob/main/helm/preconfigs/minimal.yaml).\n\n### Persisting results\n\nTo store the results of benchmark executions in a [PersistentVolume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes), `operator.resultsVolume.persistent.enabled` has to be set to `true`. This requires that either a statically provisioned PersistentVolume is available or a dynamic provisioner exists (which is the case for many Kubernetes installations). If required, you can select a storage class with `operator.resultsVolume.persistent.storageClassName`.\nYou can also use an existing PersistentVolumeClaim by setting `operator.resultsVolume.persistent.existingClaim`.\nIf persistence is not enabled, all results will be gone upon pod termination.\n\n### Exposing Grafana\n\nPer default, Theodolite exposes a Grafana instance as NodePort at port `31199`. This can configured by setting `kube-prometheus-stack.grafana.service.nodePort`.\n\n### Additional Kubernetes cluster metrics\n\nAs long as you have sufficient permissions on your cluster, you can integrate additional Kubernetes metrics into Prometheus. This involes enabling some exporters, additional Grafana dashboards and additional permissions. We provide a [values file for enabling extended metrics](https://github.com/cau-se/theodolite/blob/main/helm/preconfigs/extended-metrics.yaml).\n\nSee the [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) for more details on configuring the individual exporters.\n\n### Random scheduler\n\nInstallation of the random scheduler can be enabled via `randomScheduler.enabled`. Please note that the random scheduler is neither required in operator mode nor in standalone mode. However, it has to be installed if benchmark executions should use random scheduling.\n\n<!-- **TODO:** link-->\n\n### Multiple installations in the same cluster\n\nIn cases, where you need to install multiple Theodolite instances, it's best to use dedicated namespaces.\nMake sure to [expose Grafana on different ports](#exposing-grafana) for each installation.\nInstalling [additional cluster-level metrics](#additional-kubernetes-cluster-metrics) multiple times in the same cluster does not work.\n\n*Note that for meaningful results, usually only one benchmark should be executed at a time.*\n\n\n## Test the Installation\n\nYou can test the installation with:\n\n```sh\nhelm test theodolite\n```\n\n\n## Uninstall Theodolite\n\nThe Theodolite Helm chart can easily be removed with:\n\n```sh\nhelm uninstall theodolite\n```\n\nHelm does not remove any CRDs created by this chart. You can remove them manually with:\n\n```sh\n# CRDs for Theodolite\nkubectl delete crd executions.theodolite.rocks\nkubectl delete crd benchmarks.theodolite.rocks\n# CRDs for Prometheus operator (see https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack#uninstall-chart)\nkubectl delete crd alertmanagerconfigs.monitoring.coreos.com\nkubectl delete crd alertmanagers.monitoring.coreos.com\nkubectl delete crd podmonitors.monitoring.coreos.com\nkubectl delete crd probes.monitoring.coreos.com\nkubectl delete crd prometheusagents.monitoring.coreos.com\nkubectl delete crd prometheuses.monitoring.coreos.com\nkubectl delete crd prometheusrules.monitoring.coreos.com\nkubectl delete crd scrapeconfigs.monitoring.coreos.com\nkubectl delete crd servicemonitors.monitoring.coreos.com\nkubectl delete crd thanosrulers.monitoring.coreos.com\n# CRDs for Strimzi\nkubectl delete crd kafkabridges.kafka.strimzi.io\nkubectl delete crd kafkaconnectors.kafka.strimzi.io\nkubectl delete crd kafkaconnects.kafka.strimzi.io\nkubectl delete crd kafkamirrormaker2s.kafka.strimzi.io\nkubectl delete crd kafkamirrormakers.kafka.strimzi.io\nkubectl delete crd kafkanodepools.kafka.strimzi.io\nkubectl delete crd kafkarebalances.kafka.strimzi.io\nkubectl delete crd kafkas.kafka.strimzi.io\nkubectl delete crd kafkatopics.kafka.strimzi.io\nkubectl delete crd kafkausers.kafka.strimzi.io\nkubectl delete crd strimzipodsets.core.strimzi.io\n```\n",
