The verification is performed by unwinding the loops in the program\nand passing the resulting equation to a decision procedure. \n",

You likely already have these, if not please download and run vcredist.x64.exe from Microsoft to install them prior to running cbmc, or make sure you have Visual Studio 2019 installed.\n\nYou can download either [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) or the [Visual C++ Redistributables](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) from Microsoft for free.\n\n## Docker\n\nWe are also releasing new versions as images in [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/diffblue/cbmc).\n\nTo run the CProver suite of tools under a Docker container, make sure that\n[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is already installed in your system and\nset up correctly, and then issue:\n\n```sh\n$ docker run -it diffblue/cbmc:5.76.0\n#\n```\n\nThat will initialise an execution of the container based on the image pushed\nas part of this release. The CProver tools are present in the `$PATH` of the\ncontainer.",

CBMC requires a\ncode pre-processing environment comprising of a suitable preprocessor\nand an a set of header files.\n\n1.  **Linux:** the preprocessor and the header files typically come with\n    a package called *gcc*, which must be installed prior to the\n    installation of CBMC.\n\n2.  **Windows:** The Windows version of CBMC requires the preprocessor\n    `cl.exe`, which is part of Microsoft Visual Studio. We recommend the\n    free [Visual Studio Community](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs).\n\n3.  **MacOS:** Install the [XCode Command Line\n    Utilities](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html) prior\n    to installing CBMC. Just installing XCode alone is not enough.\n\nImportant note for Windows users: Visual Studio's `cl.exe` relies on a\ncomplex set of environment variables to identify the target architecture\nand the directories that contain the header files. You must run CBMC\nfrom within the *Visual Studio Command Prompt*.\n\nNote that the distribution files for the [Eclipse\nplugin](http://www.cprover.org/eclipse-plugin/)\ninclude the CBMC executable.  Therefore, if you intend to run CBMC\nexclusively within Eclipse, you can skip the installation of the CBMC\nexecutable.  However, you still have to install the compiler environment as\ndescribed above.\n\n## Installing the CBMC Binaries\n\n1.  Download CBMC for your operating system. The binaries are available\n    from http://www.cprover.org/cbmc/.\n2.  Unzip/untar the archive into a directory of your choice. We\n    recommend you add this directory to your `PATH` environment variable.\n\nYou are now ready to use CBMC. We recommend you follow the\n[tutorial](../cbmc/tutorial/).\n\n## Building CBMC from Source\n\nSee the [CPROVER Developer Documentation](https://diffblue.github.io/cbmc/compilation-and-development.html).\n\n# Installing the Eclipse Plugin\n\n## Requirements\n\nWe provide a graphical user interface to CBMC which is\nrealized as a plugin to the Eclipse framework. Eclipse is available at\nhttp://www.eclipse.org. Installation is very simple. Just download the\nlatest version and extract the files.\n\nImportant note for Windows users: Visual Studio's `cl.exe` relies on a\ncomplex set of environment variables to identify the target architecture\nand the directories that contain the header files. You must run Eclipse\nfrom within the *Visual Studio Command Prompt*.\n\n## Installing the Eclipse Plugin\n\nThe installation instructions for the Eclipse Plugin, including the link\nto the download site, are available\n[here](http://www.cprover.org/eclipse-plugin/). This includes a short\ntutorial on the Eclipse plugin.\n\n",

                "value": "\\page contributing_documentation Contributing documentation\n\nThe CBMC documentation is a work in progress.  The quality of the\ndocumentation depends on contributions from users and developers.\n\nEvery markdown file in the repository contributes a page to the\ndoxygen output.  By default, a page will appear at the top-level\nof the tree view of the documentation on the left side of every page\nproduced by doxygen.  You can use the `\\page` and `\\subpage` doxygen\ncommands to control where a page appears in this tree view.\n\nIf you want `child.md` to appear as a subpage of `parent.md` in the\ndocumentation, you can add\n```\n\\page child Child Page Title\n```\nto the top of `child.md` and add\n```\n\\subpage child\n```\nat the appropriate place in `parent.md`.  The `\\subpage` command will\nhave the effect of creating a link named \"Child Page Title\" to\n`child.md` in `parent.md`.  In other places (and other files),\nyou can generate a link to `child.md` with `\\ref child \"link text\"`.\nThe \"link text\" defaults to \"Child Page Title\".\n\nWhen you contribute a module `mymodule.c` to the source code, there are\nprobably at least two kinds of documentation you want to contribute.\nOne is user documentation to help people use your feature.  One is\ndeveloper documentation to help people debug or extend your work.  We\nrecommend that you put files `mymodule-user.md` and `mymodule-developer.md`\nnext to `mymodule.c` in the repository.  Then you can use the `\\page`\nand `\\subpage` mechanism described above into the appropriate parts of\nthe user guide and developer guide.\n\nWhen you contribute documentation, it may not be clear whether it should\ngo into the user guide or the developer guide.  We recommend that you\nput into the user guide everything a user needs to know to use the tool.\nFor example, put a description of the CBMC memory model into the\nuser guide.  Then the developer guide can link to that description of the\nmemory model in the user guide, and say, \"This is the memory model, and\nthis is how we implement the memory model.\"\n",
