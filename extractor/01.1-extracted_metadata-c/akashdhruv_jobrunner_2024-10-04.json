It is a flexible tool that allows\nusers to design their own directory structure and maintain consistency\nwith the increase in complexity of their workflows and experiments. \nUpgrading and uninstallation is easily managed through this interface\nusing, \nThis allow for the use of the ``instrument`` field in the Jobfile \nUse of software for data acquisition, analysis, and discovery in\nscientific studies has allowed integration of sustainable software\ndevelopment practices into the research process, enabling physics-based\nsimulation instruments like Flash-X (https://flash-x.org) to model\nproblems ranging from pool boiling to stellar explosions. However, the\ndesign and management of software-based scientific studies is often left\nto individual researchers who design their computational experiments\nbased on personal preferences and the nature of the study. \nAlthough applications are available to create reproducible capsules for\ndata generation (https://codeocean.com), they do not provide tools to\nmanage research in a structured way which can enhance knowledge related\nto decisions made by researchers to configure their software\ninstruments. A well-organized lab notebook and execution environment\nenables systematic curation of the research process and provides\nimplicit documentation for software configuration and options used to\nperform specific studies. This in turn enhances reproducibility by\nproviding a roadmap towards data generation and contributing towards\nknowledge and understanding of an experiment. \nThere are situations where requirements for Flash-X are not available as\nmodules and may have to be built from their respective source. This is\nusually the case when a specific version of the library or compiler is\ndesired.

The details of the schedular with desired\noptions is supplied by extending the ``Jobfile`` at root of the\n``Project`` directory, \nJobrunner also provides features to keep the directory structure clean.\nResults and artifacts from computational runs can be designated for\narchiving or cleaning by extending the ``Jobfile`` for each study, \n"

This can be easily\naccomplished using the ``setup`` script located in the project root\ndirectory and executing, \n   ./setup develop --with-instruments \nDevelopment mode enables testing of features/updates directly from the\nsource code and is an effective method for debugging. Note that the\n``setup`` script relies on ``click``, which can be installed using, \n   pip install click \nThe ``jobrunner`` script is installed in ``$HOME/.local/bin`` directory\nand therfore the environment variable, ``PATH``, should be updated to\ninclude this location for command line use. \n``python3.8+`` ``click`` ``toml`` ``pyyaml`` ``alive-progress`` \n   $ tree Project/sites\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 sites/\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 sedona/\n           \u251c\u2500\u2500 modules.sh \nThe site-specific subnode ``sites/sedona/`` consists of commands to load\nplatform specific compilers and libraries required to build Flash-X\nwhich is the instrument used to perform the experiments. \n   # file: Project/sites/sedona/modules.sh\n   #\n   # Load Message Passing Interface (MPI) and\n   # Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) libraries\n   module load openmpi\n   module load hdf5 \nThere are situations where requirements for Flash-X are not available as\nmodules and may have to be built from their respective source.

The ``software/`` node provides configuration details for\nthese, \n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 software/\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 Jobfile\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 setupFlashX.sh\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 setupAMReX.sh \nHere the script ``setupAMReX.sh`` provides commands to get the source\ncode for AMReX(https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex) and build it for\ndesired version and configuration. The script ``setupFlashX.sh`` sets\nthe version for Flash-X to perform the experiments. The ``Jobfile``\nindicates the use of these files by assigning them to specific Jobrunner\ncommands, \n   # file: Project/software/Jobfile\n   #\n   # Run these scripts during jobrunner setup command\n   job:\n     setup:\n       - setupAMReX.sh\n       - setupFlashX.sh \nThe ``environment.sh`` file at the root of the ``Project`` directory\nsources the site-specific ``modules.sh`` and sets environment variables\nfor compilation and execution. \n   # file: Project/environment.sh\n   #\n   # Set project home using realpath of current directory\n   export PROJECT_HOME=$(realpath .) \n   # Enter site information and source the modules\n   SiteName=\"sedona\"\n   SiteHome=\"$PROJECT_HOME/sites/$SiteName\"\n   source $SiteHome/modules.sh \n   # Set environment variables required for Makefile.h\n   export MPI_HOME=$(which mpicc | sed s/'\\/bin\\/mpicc'//)\n   export HDF5_HOME=$(which h5pfc | sed s/'\\/bin\\/h5pfc'//) \n   # Assign path for local AMReX installation\n   export AMREX2D_HOME=\"$PROJECT_HOME/software/AMReX/install-$SiteName/2D\"\n   export AMREX3D_HOME=\"$PROJECT_HOME/software/AMReX/install-$SiteName/3D\" \nThe ``Jobfile`` at this node assigns the use of ``environment.sh``, \n   # Scripts to include during jobrunner setup and submit commands\n   job:\n     setup:\n       - environment.sh\n     submit:\n       - environment.sh \nDuring the invocation of ``jobrunner setup software/`` command,\n``environment.sh``, ``setupAMReX.sh`` and ``setupFlashX.sh`` are\ncombined using the information in Jobfiles and executed in sequence to\nbuild the software stack. \n   # file: Project/simulation/PoolBoiling/Jobfile\n   #\n   job:\n     # list of scripts that need to execute during setup\n     setup:\n       - flashSetup.sh \n     # target executable created during setup\n     target: flashx \n     # list of scripts that need to execute during submit\n     submit:\n       - flashRun.sh \nDuring the invocation of ``jobrunner setup simulation/PoolBoiling``\ncommand, ``environment.sh`` and ``flashSetup.sh`` are combined using the\ninformation in Jobfiles and executed in sequence to build the target\nexecutable ``flashx``.
