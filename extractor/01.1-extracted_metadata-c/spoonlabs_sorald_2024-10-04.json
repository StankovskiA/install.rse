Prefix the title of\nthe PR with `wip:` if it is not ready to be merged. A PR will be accepted and\nmerged when:\n\n- The title of the PR is prefixed with `<CATEGORY>:`, where `<CATEGORY>` is the\n  most applicable of:\n    - `feat`: A change to user-facing features\n    - `refactor`: A refactoring\n    - `fix`: A bugfix\n    - `chore`: A change to the CI setup or other supporting files (e.g. `pom.xml`)\n    - `test`: A change to the test suite\n    - `doc`: A change to the documentation\n    - Having trouble picking a category? Open your PR anyway and a maintainer will\n    help you!\n- It is minimal in the sense of doing a single thing (for example, an addition of a single new processor and a single bug fix).\n- It has a clear explanation of its goal and what was changed.\n- It passes in the continuous integration service being used in the project.\n- If the PR relates to an issue, the first line in the body says `Fix\n  #<ISSUE_NUMBER>` if it resolves the issue, or just `#<ISSUE_NUMBER>` if it is\n  related but does not resolve the issue.\n    - See the [PR that introduced this very line](https://github.com/SpoonLabs/sorald/pull/239) for an example\n    - Contributions such as touch-ups to documentation, new test cases and pure\n      refactorings do not need to be related to an issue\n\n> **Note:** _Change_ in this context means any of _addition_, _removal_ or\n> _modification_.\n\n### Guidelines for maintainers\n\nWhen merging a PR, maintainers should take care to:\n\n* Squash the merge\n* Ensure that the squash message starts with the `<CATEGORY>:` prefix\n* Ensure that the squash message ends with `(#<PR_NUMBER>)`\n* Ensure that any related issue is properly referenced in the PR body\n\n### Guidelines for new-processor pull-requests\n\nFor adding a new processor in Sorald, please, follow the instructions described below.\n\n0) Familiarize yourself with the [`sorald.util` utility package](#reusable-utility-classes-and-methods)\n\nThis is to ensure that you do not recreate functionality that we already have a\nsolution for.\n\n1) Find the name for the new processor\n\nThe first step is to find the name for the new processor.\nTo do so, you need to find the name that SonarSource uses for the rule that the new processor targets.\nSo let's suppose that the new processor targets the rule [\"Math operands should be cast before assignment\"](https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/type/Bug/RSPEC-2184), rule key 2184.\nIn [SonarSource for Java](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-java/tree/master/java-checks/src/main/java/org/sonar/java/checks), you will find that such a rule is implemented by the class `CastArithmeticOperandCheck`.\nSo the name of your new processor is `CastArithmeticOperandCheck` replacing \"Check\" by \"Processor\", resulting in `CastArithmeticOperandProcessor`.\n\n2) Create the processor\n\nOnce you have the name for the new processor, you can create a class using that\nname in `src/main/java/sorald/processor`.  This new class must extend\n`SoraldAbstractProcessor` and implement the abstract methods, and be annotated\nwith `ProcessorAnnotation`.\n\n> See the documentation for the abstract methods in\n> [SoraldAbstractProcessor](src/main/java/sorald/processor/SoraldAbstractProcessor.java),\n> and check out [the existing implementations\n> here](/src/main/java/sorald/processor) for guidance.\n\nAs soon as you have created a skeleton for the processor, with the\n`ProcessorAnnotation` properly filled in, you should update the `Processors`\nclass. You do this by running the main method of `sorald.CodeGenerator`, which\nyou can either do with your favorite IDE, or by running the following shell\ncommands in `bash`:\n\n```bash\n$ mvn clean compile dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=cp.txt\n$ java -cp \"$(cat cp.txt):./target/classes\" sorald.CodeGenerator\n$ mvn spotless:apply\n```\n\nAfter that, you can start developing your processor for real! Note that if you\nupdate the annotations of your processor, you must update the `Processors`\nclass again as described above.\n\n> **Complicated?:** The procedure for adding a processor is a little bit\n> contrived. It used to be automatic through processor annotations, which\n> worked excellently with Maven, but we experienced so many issues with IDE and\n> editor integration that we eventually gave up on it.\n\n3) Add at least one test file with expected output for your processor\n\nSee [Guidelines for testing processors](#guidelines-for-testing-processors) for\ndetails.\n\n4) Ensure compliance with code style\n\nWe have an automatically enforced code style in sorald, and your code will not\npass CI if it does not adhere to it. To ensure that your code does adhere to it,\nrun `mvn spotless:apply`, and then commit any changes the formatter makes.\n\n5) Update documentation\n\nYour processor is done, it's passing the minimum tests, so now you can update the documentation.\nWrite a summary of the processor supporting it with an example in <PROCESSOR_NAME>.md file and place it inside the\n`sorald.processor` package. For example, if your processor is in `CastArithmeticOperandProcessor.java`, then\nthe description file must be called `CastArithmeticOperandProcessor.md`.\n\n6) Open a PR\n\nThe processor, the tests, and the documentation being ready, your contribution is also ready to be used in a PR.\nOpen a PR, with the title \"feat: Add <PROCESSOR_NAME> (SonarSource rule <RULE_KEY_NUMBER>)\".\nFor the description of the PR, use the following template:  \n\nThis PR adds a processor for the rule [<RULE_DESCRIPTION, which should be the title of the rule in the https://rules.sonarsource.com/java webpage>](LINK TO THE RULE IN THE https://rules.sonarsource.com/java WEBPAGE).\n\nTransformation:\n\n```diff\n<Here it goes the diff between your resource file (the one used in the test) and the Sorald generated output for it>\n```\n\nAnd then you can submit your PR!\n\n### Reusable utility classes and methods\n\nIn the [sorald.util](/src/main/java/sorald/util) package we collect utility classes\nand methods for use throughout Sorald. It's a good idea to have a look through\nit before writing a processor. For example, the\n[Transformations](/src/main/java/sorald/util/Transformations.java) class contains\nhigh-level transformations that may be of use to you.\n\n### Guidelines for testing processors\n\nTests for the processors are automatically generated based on a set of test\nfiles in\n[src/test/resources/processor_test_files](/src/test/resources/processor_test_files).\nTo add test files for a processor, you must find or create a subdirectory called\n`<RULE_KEY>_<RULE_NAME>`, were you substitute `<RULE_KEY>` for the key of the\nrule your processor is related to, and `<RULE_NAME>` for the name of the\nprocessor without to `Processor` suffix. In this subdirectory, you add _test\nfiles_ and _expected files_ for the processor, which are described in more\ndetail below.\n\n#### Test files\n\nA _test file_ is a `.java` source file with at least one violation of the\nconsidered rule. Sorald's test suite automatically converts each test file\ninto a test case for the processor. Each violation in a test file _must_ be\nmarked with an inline comment `// Noncompliant`, like so.\n\n```java\n\"a\" == \"b\" // Noncompliant\n```\n\n> Note the capital `N` in `Noncompliant`!\n\n##### A test file is a test case\n\nAs each test file generates a test case, it is good practice to create one test\nfile per specific case you want to test, and document it with a header. To avoid\nan explosion of test files, we typically create one test file for the general\noperation of a processor, and then individual files for edge cases.\n\nThe name of the test file should ideally reflect what the test case is about,\nbut there are otherwise no particular naming conventions.\n\n> See\n> [src/test/java/sorald/processor/ProcessorTest.java](/src/test/java/sorald/processor/ProcessorTest.java)\n> if you are curious as to how tests are generated from the test files.\n\n##### Test files should be standalone compilable\n\nIn general, a test file must be _standalone compilable_ given only the standard\nlibrary. In other words, it must be syntactically correct, can't reference types\nthat are not part of the standard library, etc. You can easily test this by\nsimply running `javac` on your test file.\n\n> **Important:** Note that this means that test files must abide by Java\n> conventions of having the name of the primary type declaration in the class\n> match the name of the file.\n\nIn some cases, the point of the test case is that the test file does not\ncompile, typically due types or packages that aren't available being referenced.\nTo signify this, the test file name (as well as the class name) should be\nprefixed with `NOCOMPILE`, which will cause it to be ignored by tests that\nrequire compilation.\n\n> **Important:** Don't forget to also prefix the primary type's name with\n> `NOCOMPILE`, such that the file name matches the type name.\n\nIf a test file should be ignored completely, prefix it with `IGNORE` instead.\nThis is useful for keeping test files that Sorald currently cannot handle.\n\n#### Expected files\n\nAn _expected file_ is a `.java` source file that contains the expected output\nafter processing a test file, marked by having the suffix `.expected` tacked on\nto the end. For example, given a test file `A.java` the corresponding expected\nfile would be called `A.java.expected`. After processing `A.java` with the\nappropriate processor, the test suite compares the results to `A.java.expected`\nwith an AST comparison, meaning that most formatting differences are **not**\ncaptured (but e.g. method order still matters).\n\nWhen you add a test file, you should always add a corresponding expected file.\nOtherwise, the test suite can verify that the violations are removed, but not\nthat the output is actually correct, making for weak tests.\n\nFor a concrete example of a test file and expected file pair, see\n[ArrayHashCodeAndToString.java](/src/test/resources/processor_test_files/2116_ArrayHashCodeAndToString/ArrayHashCodeAndToString.java)\nand its expected output\n[ArrayHashCodeAndToString.java.expected](/src/test/resources/processor_test_files/2116_ArrayHashCodeAndToString/ArrayHashCodeAndToString.java.expected).\nFor more examples, see\n[src/test/resources/processor_test_files](/src/test/resources/processor_test_files).\n\n#### Exact match files\n\nAn _exact match file_ contains one or more code snippets that is expected to be\npresent after Sorald has processed a test file, and is marked by having the\nsuffix `.exact`. For example, given a test file `A.java`, the corresponding\nexact match file is `A.java.exact`. Whereas the expected files are matched with\nan AST comparison, the code snippets of exact match files are asserted to be\nliteral substrings of the output file contents, in order.\n\nA simple exact match file contains only a single code snippet to be matched as a\nsubstring. _Do keep in mind that indentation matters!_. For an example, see\n[DeadVariableWithMultipleDeadStores.java.exact](src/test/resources/processor_test_files/1854_DeadStore/DeadVariableWithMultipleDeadStores.java.exact).\n\nAn exact match file can contain multiple code snippets, where each snippet\nexcept for the last one is terminated with a line containing only `###`. See\n[UpperClass.java.exact](src/test/resources/processor_test_files/2057_SerialVersionUidCheck/UpperClass.java.exact)\nfor an example.\n\n> **Important:** Exact match files should be used sparingly, and should only\n> capture formatting that's of absolute relevance to Sorald itself and its\n> transformations. Overspecifying exact matches leads to unnecessary work down\n> the line.\n\n#### Testing partially fixable rules\n\nSome processors cannot repair all cases of a violation, and they are called\n`IncompleteProcessor`. To keep track of which cases we do not attempt to\nrepair, one can create test files prefixed with `INCOMPLETE`. The test suite\nwill ensure that the violation persists after Sorald is run. See\n[INCOMPLETE_DoNotCastFloat.java](sorald/src/test/resources/processor_test_files/S2164_MathOnFloat/INCOMPLETE_DoNotCastFloat.java)\nfor an example.\n",
