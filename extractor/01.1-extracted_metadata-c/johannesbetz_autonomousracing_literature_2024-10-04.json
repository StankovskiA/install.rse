People can integrate new papers in this last and/or even extend the list to more categories. \n**Preliminary Remarks and Autonomous Racing Definition:** \\\nAs stated in the paper, the term of autonomous racing can be referred to different applications (e.g. drone racing) but we are focusing in this list only on research in the field of autonomous racing **cars**. These racecars need to have four wheels, can either have a combustion engine or electrical engine as a main power unit, can be real racecars (e.g. Formula 1 car) or small-scale vehicles (e.g. 1:10 scale). In addition, the soft- and hardware that is displayed in this list must have a clear connection to the field of racing. This means that the authors of these papers either used a specific hardware that is acting in a racing environment (e.g. racetrack, adversarial setup), they are using a simulation environment that displays a racecar within an racing environment (e.g. racing game for PC) or their research displays a solution for a racing problem (e.g. driving fast around the racetrack). Although some authors present results and algorithms for high speed autonomous driving on the freeway this work is **not** covered in this survey because neither the aspect of handling the cars at the limit nor the adversarial context is given here sufficiently. \n",
