Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) are networks of wearable and implantable sensors that collect physiological data (e.g., heart beat rate, blood oxigenation) from the human body. These networks are often considered safety-critical, as they enable real-time monitoring of vital signs and other health-related parameters. In addition, they interface a body of knowledge of ever evolving diseases and health conditions with a the vastness of human individuality. No solution to indentification of health conditions is comprehensive enough to tackle the current nor future diseases that may pose a threat to human condition. The self-adaptive body sensor network paves the way to such ambitious goal. \n",

Each logfile is named after a type of message and an id (i.e., logName_logID) and the entries are composed by the messages content.\n\nTo compute the evolution of the QoS attributes (i.e., reliability and cost) over time and how well the adaptation manager adapts the system, we use a python script that reads the logs as input and plots a timeseries + displays adaptation metrics as output.\n\nThe python script can be found at sa-bsn/src/sa-bsn/simulation/analyzer.\n\nTo compute the QoS attributes and analyze the adaptation, type:\n\n```\ncd bsn/src/sa-bsn/simulation/analyzer\npython3 analyzer.py [logID] [metric] [plot_component_metrics] [setpoint]\n```\n\nwhere:\n\n* [logID] is the ID for the execution log files.\n* [metric] is the name of the QoS attribute (e.g., reliability)\n* [plot_component_metrics] is a boolean parameter that defines whether individual component's QoS attribute should be plotted or not.\n* [setpoint] is the value of the setpoint used in the execution.\n\nOne example of the command usage is:\n\n```\npython3 analyzer.py 1610549979516318295 reliability False 0.9\n```\n",
