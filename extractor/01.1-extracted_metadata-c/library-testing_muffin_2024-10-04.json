However, previous work has shown that DL libraries, the basis of building and executing DL models, contain bugs and can cause severe consequences. Unfortunately, existing approaches still cannot comprehensively excise DL libraries. They utilize existing trained models and only detect bugs in model inference phase. In this work we propose ***Muffin*** to address these issues. To this end, *Muffin* applies a specifically-designed model fuzzing approach, which allows it to generate diverse DL models to explore the target library, instead of relying only on existing trained models. *Muffin* makes differential testing feasible in the model training phase by tailoring a set of metrics to measure the inconsistency between different DL libraries. In this way, *Muffin* can best excise the library code to detect more bugs. Experiments on three widely-used DL libraries show that *Muffin* can detect **39 new bugs**.\n\nYou can access this repository using the following command:\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/library-testing/Muffin.git\n```\n\n\n",
