You can help \nby simply asking your colleagues or friends about their opinion on mutation testing.\n\n### Give it a try\n\nTry using Mull on one of your projects, or on one of the many open source\nprojects. Mull uses JIT for performance and flexibility, which is inherently\ncomplex and easy to get wrong. We covered some cases, but certainly not all of\nthem. The project would benefit from more samples.\n\n### Ask questions\n\nYou might get confused by the documentation, or by our design decisions. Some of\nthe decisions are done on purpose, some of them are accidental. If something is\nnot clear, confusing, or can be improved - please open an issue and raise your\nconcern.\n\n### File a bug report\n\nIf you gave it a try, then you probably hit some bug or crash. Please, file\na report, we will take care of it eventually.\n\n### Implement new features\n\nThere is a non-exhaustive [list](https://github.com/mull-project/mull/issues)\nof planned features. Feel free to implement any of them, or come up with some\nfeatures you think would be beneficial for the project.\n\nHere is the starting point: [Hacking on Mull](https://mull.readthedocs.io/en/latest/HackingOnMull.html).\n\n",
