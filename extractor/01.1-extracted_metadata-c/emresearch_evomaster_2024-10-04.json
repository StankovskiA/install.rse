Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3.

                "value": "_EvoMaster_ ([www.evomaster.org](http://evomaster.org)) is the first (2016) open-source AI-driven tool\nthat automatically *generates* system-level test cases\nfor web/enterprise applications.\nThis is related to [Fuzzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing).\nNot only _EvoMaster_ can generate inputs that find program crashes, but also it generates small effective test suites (e.g., in JUnit format) that can be used for _regression testing_.\n\n_EvoMaster_ is an AI driven tool.\nIn particular, internally it uses an [Evolutionary Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm)\nand [Dynamic Program Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_program_analysis)  to be\nable to generate effective test cases.\nThe approach is to *evolve* test cases from an initial population of\nrandom ones, trying to maximize measures like code coverage and fault detection.\n_EvoMaster_ uses several kinds of AI heuristics to improve performance even further,\nbuilding on decades of research in the field of [Search-Based Software Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search-based_software_engineering).\n\n\n__Key features__:\n\n* _Web APIs_: At the moment, _EvoMaster_ can generate test cases for __REST__, __GraphQL__ and __RPC__ (e.g., __gRPC__ and __Thrift__) APIs.\n\n* _Black-Box_ testing mode: can run on any API (regardless of its programming language, e.g., Python and Go).\n  However, results for black-box testing will be worse than white-box testing (e.g., due to lack of code analysis).\n  Default test case output is in Python, but other formats are available as well. \n\n* _White-Box_ testing mode: can be used for APIs compiled to\n  JVM (e.g., Java and Kotlin). _EvoMaster_ analyses the bytecode of the tested applications, and uses\n  several heuristics such as _testability transformations_ and _taint analysis_ to be able to generate\n  more effective test cases. We support JDK __8__ and the major LTS versions after that (currently JDK __21__). Might work on other JVM versions, but we provide __NO__ support for it.\n  Note: there was initial support for other languages as well, like for example JavaScript/TypeScript and C#, but they were not in a stable, feature-complete state. The support for those languages for white-box testing has been dropped, at least for the time being. \n\n* _Installation_: we provide installers for the main operating systems: _Windows_ (`.msi`),\n  _OSX_ (`.dmg`) and _Linux_ (`.deb`). We also provide an uber-fat JAR file.\n  To download them, see the [Release page](https://github.com/WebFuzzing/EvoMaster/releases).\n  Release notes are present in the file [release_notes.md](https://github.com/WebFuzzing/EvoMaster/blob/master/release_notes.md).\n  If you are using the uber-fat JAR, it should work with any major LTS version (from JDK 8 on).\n   Whereas for the client library, needed for white-box testing, we will support JDK 8 likely for a long, long while, be warned that future versions of the executable JAR might start to require higher versions of the JDK in a non-so-distant future.\n   If that is going to be higher than your current version of the JVM, if you cannot upgrade or have 2 different JDKs on your machine, then you should not use the uber-jar but rather one of the installers. \n   When you use one of the installers, keep in mind that currently they do not update the `PATH` variable. This needs to be done manually, [see documentation](docs/download.md). \n\n* _State-of-the-art_: an [independent study (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08348), comparing 10 fuzzers on 20 RESTful APIs, shows that _EvoMaster_ gives the best results.\n\n* _Schema_: REST APIs must provide a schema in [OpenAPI/Swagger](https://swagger.io)\n  format (either _v2_ or _v3_).\n\n* _Output_: the tool generates _JUnit_ (version 4 or 5) tests, written in either Java or Kotlin, as well as test suites in Python and JavaScript. For a complete list, see the documentation for the CLI parameter [--outputFormat](docs/options.md). \n  Some examples are: PYTHON_UNITTEST, KOTLIN_JUNIT_5, JAVA_JUNIT_4 and JS_JEST.\n  Note that the generated tests rely on third-party libraries (e.g., to make HTTP calls). \n  These will need to be setup in your projects, [see documentation](docs/library_dependencies.md).\n\n* _Fault detection_: _EvoMaster_ can generate tests cases that reveal faults/bugs in the tested applications.\n  Different heuristics are employed, like checking for 500 status codes and mismatches from the API schemas.\n\n* _Self-contained tests_: for white-box testing, the generated tests do start/stop the application, binding to an ephemeral port.\n  This means that the generated tests can be used for _regression testing_ (e.g., added to the Git repository\n  of the application, and run with any build tool such as Maven and Gradle).\n  For black-box testing, you will need to make sure the application is up and running before executing the tests. \n\n\n* _SQL handling_: for white-box testing, _EvoMaster_ can intercept and analyse all communications done with SQL databases, and use\n  such information to generate higher code coverage test cases. Furthermore, it can generate data directly\n  into the databases, and have such initialization automatically added in the generated tests.\n  At the moment, _EvoMaster_ supports _Postgres_, _MySQL_ and _H2_  databases.\n\n\n* _Authentication_: we support auth based on authentication headers and cookies.\n  Besides using fixed HTTP headers, \n  it is also possible to declaratively specify which login endpoint should be used to dynamically obtain authentication info (e.g., auth tokens or cookies) for each test execution. [See documentation](docs/auth.md).\n\n__Known limitations__:\n\n* _Driver_: to be used for _white-box_ testing, users need to write a [driver manually](docs/write_driver.md).\n  We recommend to try _black-box_ mode first (should just need a few minutes to get it up and running) to get\n  an idea of what _EvoMaster_ can do for you.\n\n* _JDK 9+_: white-box testing requires bytecode manipulation. \n            Each new release of the JDK makes doing this harder and harder. \n            Dealing with JDKs above __8__ is doable, but it requires some settings.\n            [See documentation](docs/jdks.md).\n\n* _Execution time_: to get good results, you might need to run the search for several hours.\n  We recommend to first try the search for 10 minutes, just to get an idea of what type of tests can be generated.\n  But, then, you should run _EvoMaster_ for something like between 1 and 24 hours (the longer the better, but\n  it is unlikely to get better results after 24 hours).\n\n* _RPC APIs_: for the moment, we do not directly support RPC schema definitions. Fuzzing RPC APIs requires to write a driver, using the client library of the API to make the calls.\n\n* _External services_: (e.g., other RESTful APIs) currently there is no support for them (e.g., to automatically mock them).\n  It is work in progress.\n\n* _NoSQL databases_: (e.g., MongoDB) currently no support. It is work in progress.\n\n* _Failing tests_: the tests generated by _EvoMaster_ should all pass, and not fail, even when they detect a fault.\n  In those cases, comments/test-names would point out that a test is revealing a possible fault, while still passing.\n  However, in some cases the generated tests might fail. This is due to the so called _flaky_ tests, e.g., when\n  a test has assertions based on the time clock (e.g., dates and timestamps).\n  There is ongoing effort to address this problem, but it is still not fully solved.\n\n \n\n\n",
