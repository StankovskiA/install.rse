Events violating any normal pattern are identified as anomalies. \n\nBy combining dependency and proximity, LogDP is able to achieve high detection accuracy. Extensive experiments have been conducted on real-world datasets, and the results show that LogDP outperforms six state-of-the-art methods.\n",
