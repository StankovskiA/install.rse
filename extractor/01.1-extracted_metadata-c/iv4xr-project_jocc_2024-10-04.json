                "value": "JOCC is a 'model-based' approach, as opposed to e.g. a machine-learning based approach. This means that we first to construct a model of the SUT's users' 'mental process' (we will get back to what this means later). JOCC then uses this model to calculate which emotions would emerge when a user observes/experiences certain events, and how the intensity of these emotions would decay over time. So, if we now run a test scenario on the SUT, and let JOCC monitors the run, it then can predict which emotions would emerge during the scenario. This can be matched with some requirements as a form of User Experience (UX) testing. \nJOCC's most important source of information for its emotion calculation is the current likelihood of achieving each goal. Well.. we don't actually know this likelihood. This is ok, because what we want is not the actual likelihood, but rather, how players would perceive what the likelihood is (e.g. do players think that achieving g1 now becomes quite likely, or conversely very unlikely?). We also don't know how players would perceive this, but we can still model how we think they would perceive. This is what is meant by \"modelling players' mental process\" that we mentioned before. In fact, specifying all parameters that JOCC needs before we can use it (e.g. specifying what the players' goals are, the desirability of events, and how they affect goals' likelihood etc) is what we mean by modelling players. In JOCC, this is called **Player Characterization**; JOCC will need such a characterization before it can do its work. \n",
