(You may see `Waiting for services in docker ready...` in the console).\n\n**Note**: During the experiment running, please don't minimize the window of the browser in VirtualBox, or the VirtualBox itself. Minimizing the windows would break the web testing process. \n\nEach experiment will take one hour, but you can interrupt the experiment and see partial results. **To interrupt the experiment**, press `CTRL-C` to send `SIGINT` signal. \nIf the experiment is interrupted, you need to manually stop the docker-compose services using `yarn workspace @darcher/examples cleanup:<subject>`.\n",
