Should the extension fail to download and install PVS Allegro, try to download and install PVS Allegro manually from https://pvs.csl.sri.com/. Should everything else fail, please report the problem on the [PVS group on Google](https://groups.google.com/g/pvs-group), we will help you out.\n\n**Automatic installation of VSCode-PVS from the Marketplace (recommended)**\n- Search `pvs` in https://marketplace.visualstudio.com and select `install`\n<br><br><img src=\"https://github.com/nasa/vscode-pvs/raw/master/vscode-pvs/screenshots/how-to-install-vscode-pvs-from-marketplace.gif\" width=\"600\">\n\n**Manual installation of VSCode-PVS from GitHub**\n1. Download the .vsix file of VSCode-PVS from [github](https://github.com/nasa/vscode-pvs/raw/master/releases).\n2. Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar \n3. Click on the `...` menu in the title bar, and use `Install from VSIX` to select the downloaded .vsix file\n<br><br><img src=\"https://github.com/nasa/vscode-pvs/raw/master/vscode-pvs/screenshots/how-to-install-vscode-pvs.gif\" width=\"600\">\n\n<br>\n\n**Installation of PVS Allegro**\n\nIf PVS Allegro is not already installed on your machine, VSCode-PVS will automatically download and install it. Should VSCode-PVS fail to download and install PVS Allegro, please try the following two steps:\n1. Download PVS Allegro v7.1.0 for [MacOS](https://pvs.csl.sri.com/license.html?tgzfile=pvs7.1.0-ix86_64-Linux-allegro.tgz) or [Linux](https://pvs.csl.sri.com/license.html?tgzfile=pvs-6.0-ix86_64-Linux-allegro.tgz)\n2. Follow the installation instructions reported in the `INSTALL` file included in the downloaded PVS package. \n\nOnce PVS Allegro is installed on your machine, you can link up PVS and VSCode-PVS by indicating the location of the PVS executables in the VSCode-PVS settings.\n\n<br>\n",
